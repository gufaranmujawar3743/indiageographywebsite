1. Physiographic of India
About India
India is the seventh largest country in the world in terms of area. It lies on the Indian Plate,
which is the northern portion of the Indo-Australian Plate. The Indian subcontinent is
surrounded by three different water bodies and is easily recognisable on the world map.
Location
The Indian mainland extends between 8°4′ North and 37°6′ North latitudes and from 68°7′
East and 97°25′ East longitudes. Thus, the latitudinal and the North-south extent is 3214 km
and East-west extentis 2933 km. India accounts 2.42% of the total world land area
India lies entirely in the northern hemisphere, and eastern hemisphere. The Tropic of Cancer
(23°30′ North) passes through the centre of the country. It divides the country into almost
two equal parts Northward of this latitude is North India and South of it is known as South
India. Similarly 82°30′ East longitude passes almost from the middle of the country. It is
known as Standard Meridian of India.
India is the largest country in terms of area and population in South-Asia. It is surrounded by
the ocean. India is strategically located in the Indian Ocean. It commands sea routes between
Europe and Africa, SouthEast Asia, far East Asia and Oceania. It is because of this that India
shares good trade relation between many countries since ancient times
Size
India’s total area accounts for about 2.4% of the total geographical area of the world. Thus, it
is the 7th largest country in the world, by its size.
 India has a land boundary of about 15,200 km.
 The total length of the coastline of the mainland is 7,516.6 km including Andaman
and Nicobar and Lakshadweep.
 India is bounded by the mountains in the northwest, north and northeast. South of
about 22° north latitude, it begins to taper and extends towards the Indian Ocean,
dividing it into two seas, the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal on its
east.
 Time along the Standard Meridian of India (82°30’E) passing through Mirzapur (in
Uttar Pradesh) is taken as the standard time for India.

India and the World
The Indian landmass has a central location between the East and West Asia. India is a
southward extension of the Asian continent. The trans-Indian Ocean routes connect the
countries of Europe in the West and the countries of East Asia. No other country has as long
a coastline on the Indian Ocean as India has. India’s contacts with the World have continued
through the ages. The spices, muslin and other merchandise were taken from India to
different countries. On the other hand, the influence of Greek sculpture, and the architectural
styles of domes and minarets from West Asia can be seen in different parts of India.
India’s Neighbours
India has 29 states and seven Union Territories. India shares its land boundaries with:
 Pakistan and Afghanistan in the northwest
 China (Tibet), Nepal and Bhutan in the north
 Myanmar and Bangladesh in the east
Physical Features of India
 Physiography of an area is the
outcome of structure, process and the
stage of development. The land of
India exhibits great physical
variations.
 Indian landmass was the part of great
Pangaea (entire landmass) which
broke into two parts in the
Carboniferous Period due to the force
of gravity and buoyancy. The
northern and southern parts were
subsequently called as Laurasia and
Gondwanaland, respectively, leaving

Tethys Sea in the middle.
 Based on these macro variations, India can be divided into the following physiographic
divisions:
(1) The Northern and North-eastern Mountains
(2) The Northern Plain
(3) The Peninsular Plateau
(4) The Indian Desert
(5) The Coastal Plains
(6) The Islands
 Geologically, The Himalayan mountains represent a very youthful topography with high
peaks, deep valleys and fast-moving rivers. The Himalayas and the Northern Plains are
the most recent landforms. The Peninsular Plateau constitutes one of the ancient
landmasses and most stable land blocks on the earth’s surface. The Northern Plains are
formed of alluvial deposits and the Peninsular Plateau is composed of igneous and
metamorphic rocks with gently rising hills and wide valleys.
 Gondwanaland further broke up into the peninsular India, Madagascar, Australia,
Antarctica etc in the Jurassic Period.
 Peninsular part of India is a part of Gondwanaland, formed from igneous rocks of
Archean era which were transformed into Gneiss and Schist.
11
2. Northern Mountain Ranges
Northern Mountain Ranges
 The Himalayas stretching over the northern borders of India are geologically young and
structurally fold mountain ranges of the world. The formation of Himalayas took place
due to the collision of the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate.
 Himalayas extending from the Indus Gorge in the west Brahmaputra Gorge in the east
terminates suddenly taking sharp southward bend. These bends are called Syntaxial bends
of the Himalayas.

 Zemu Sikkim/Nepal 25
 Milam Uttarakhand 19
 Kanchenjunga Sikkim/Nepal 16
Valley
A valley is a low lying area between hills or mountains. Geographically, the fertile plains of the
rivers are known as the river valley.

Trans-Himalayas/Tibetan Himalayas
 Trans-Himalayas are the northern parts of the Great Himalayas. These ranges have been
formed from sedimentary rocks. Antecedent rivers like Sutlej, Indus, Brahmaputra or
Tsangpo originate from this region.
 It is separated in the north from Great Himalayas by the Indus-Tsangpo Suture Zone
(ITSZ) or Kailash mountain ranges are categorized under this Himalayas.
 Karakoram ranges are known as the backbone of the Asia. The highest mountain peak of
India, K² or Godwin Austen is located in this range.
 Karakoram ranges meet the Pamir knot in the west whereas it is extended in the south-
east as Kailash range. In the south of this range, Ladakh range acts as a water divide
between Indus River and its tributary Shyok River.

(Based on age of formation)
Rakaposhi is one of world’s steepest mountain peak located in Ladakh ranges.
Indus River flows between Zanskar and Ladakh range and forms the deepest Gorge (5,200 m) in India by cutting
the Ladakh range at bunji.
14
Greater Himalayas
 These are also known as Inner Himalayas or Himadri. This is the highest range of
Himalayas. The average height of this range is 6,100 m. It contains all the major ranges
of the Himalayas. It ranges 120 km to 190 km.
 Great Himalayan range, also known as the Central Axial range, extends from the gorge of
Indus River to the bend of Brahmaputra river in Arunachal Pradesh.
 Almost all the lofty peaks of the world are located in this range. Mt Everest,
Kanchenjunga, Nanga Parbat, Nanda Devi, Kamet and Namcha Barwa are its important
range.
Middle or the lesser Himalayas
 These are also known as Himachal.
 Greater Himalayas is separated from the Middle Himalayas by the Main Central Thrust.
Its breadth is 60-80 km and average height is 3,000-4,500m.
 Some peaks in this range are more than 5,000 m high and the river flow through deep
gorges upto 1,000 m.
 These are part of the Himalayan mountain system having their general alignment form
north to south direction.
 In the north, they are known as Patkai Bum, Naga Hills, the Manipur hills and Mizo or
Lushai hills. These are low hills, inhabited by numerous tribal groups practicing Jhum
cultivation.
 Most of these ranges are separated from each other by numerous small rivers like Barak
which is an important river of Manipur and Mizoram.
 Mizoram is also known as the Molassis basin, which is made up of soft unconsolidated
deposits.
Famous Duns: Dehradun, Kotlidun, Patlidun.

3. Peninsular Plateau
The formation of peninsular plateau can be traced to the Paleozoic era. It was formed due to the
breaking and the drifting of the Gondwanaland because of which it is a part of an old landmass.
Aravalli Ranges
 Aravalli ranges are located on the western and north-western side of the Peninsular
plateau which are highly dissected and are relict of the world’s oldest mountain.
 Aravalli hills extend upto 800 km from south-west in Gujarat to north-east in Delhi.
They are known as Delhi Ridge near Delhi. The average height of Aravalli is 300-920 m.
its highest peak, gurushikhar near Mt. Abu is 1,722 m high.
 These ranges were formed 600 to 570 million years ago during Pre-Cambrian period.
 Mahi and Luhi River originates from the west of Aravallies. Luni river disappears in the
Rann of Kutch.
Vindhayan Ranges

groups i.e. Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. Along with that there are many islands in the
Ganga-Sagar and Mahanadi delta.
 There are around 572 islands in the Bay of Bengal in which human habitation is found
only in 36 islands. These islands are located between 6°45’-14°N latitude and 92°- 94°E
longitude.
 The islands of the Bay of Bengal reflect the land characteristics of the submerged tertiary
mountain ranges. Arakan Yoma is an example of remains of submerged highlands.
Andaman and Nicobar Islands
 Andaman and Nicobar islands are located in Bay of Bengal near the Myanmar coast. The
prominent ranges of this island are Saddle peak (North Andaman – 732 m), Mount

21
5. Classification of Indian Rocks
Archean Rocks
 These are the oldest and primary rocks. The cooling and solidification of the upper crust
of the earth‘s surface in the pre-Cambrian era resulted in formation of Archean rocks.
About 86.7% part of the earth’s historical formation has been done in the Pre-Cambrian
era (Archena era).
 The tow-third part of Indian Peninsula is made up of Archean rocks. The three fully
defined types of Archean rocks found in peninsular India are-
(i) Bengal Gneiss
(ii) Bundelkhand Gneiss (oldest)
(iii) Nilgiri Gneiss
 Archean rocks are the repository of India’s mineral wealth. These rocks have abundance
of metallic and non-metallic mineerals like Iron, Copper, Manganese, Asbestos,
Dolomite, Zinc, Silver and Gold.
 These rocks are found mainly in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh, Odisha, Chotanagapur Plateau, South Easten Rajasthan.
Dharwar Rocks
 These are the oldest metamorphosis sedimentary rocks formed from the erosion and
deposition of the Archean rocks. These are highly metamorphosed and are devoid of
fossils. These rocks are found in Dharwar and Bellary districts of Karnataka, Aravalli
Range, Balaghat, Rewa, Chottanagur, etc. Iron ore, copper and gold are the major minerals
found in these rocks.
 Aravalli Mountains are formed in this rock system, which are the oldest fold mountains of
the world. These rocks are found in Dharwar and Shimoga districts of Karnataka. This has
been found in both peninsular and extra peninsular region.
 Dharwar rocks are found in three regions:
1. In Dharwar and Bellary districts of Karnataka which spreads into Nilgiri and Madurai
districts of Tamil Nadu.
22
2. It has expanded to Middle East regions of Chhotanagapur, Meghalaya Plateau and
Mikir hills.
3. These rocks reach upto the Aravallis of Delhi, Delhi ridge to Alwar and Himachal
Pradesh.
Cuddappah Rocks
 These rocks have been formed by the erosion and deposition of Dharwar rocks. They are
less metamorphosed but still devoid of fossils. These rocks are found in Krishna valley,
Nallamalai hills, Papadahani and Cheyyar valleys. A Cuddappah rock of Rajasthan is also
known as Delhi Ridge. These are also sedimentary rocks.
 It is famous for sandstone, limestone, marble and asbestos. Diamonds are also found in
same rocks system.
Vindhyan Rocks
 It is named after Vindhyan Mountain which acts as water-divide between the Gangetic
plains and the Deccan plateau.
 It is famous for limestone, china clay, dolomite etc.
 These are sedimentary rocks formed by the deposition of silt of river valleys and shallow
oceans. These rocks are spread form Chittorgarh of Rajasthan to Sasaram of Bihar.
Gondwana Rocks
 These are the rocks formed in Upper Carboniferous to Jurassic era, hence these are
especially important for coal deposits.
 About 98% of the coal deposits of India are found in these rocks. These are stratified
rocks in which the fossils of fishes and reptiles are found.
Deccan Trap
 This was formed in Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic era. At the end of the Mesozoic
era, an extensive volcano erupted through fissure and a vast area of about 10 lakh km² got
buried under the lava.
Bhander ranges, Bikawar ranges and Kaimur ranges come under Vindhyan
ranges.
23
 In this region, the thickness of basaltic lava is 600- 1,500 m and even at some places it is
3,000 m. this region is known as Deccan Tap. The Raj Mahal trap was formed even earlier
in the Jurassic period.
 The Deccan Trap is found in most parts of Maharashtra, Gujarat and South-western
Madhaya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
 This structure is made up of Basalt and Dolomite rocks. These rocks are quite harsh.
 Black soil has been formed by the fragmentation of these rocks, which is known as Black
Cotton Soil or Regur Soil.
Tertiary Rocks
 The tertiary rocks have been formed between the Eocene era and the Pliocene era.
 The tertiary rocks are found mainly in the Himalayan region. In peninsular India, these
are only limited to coastal areas. Petroleum is also found in this series or rocks. This
series is found in a developed form in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand where it is
known as the Lilang series.
Quaternary Roacks
 The quaternary rocks include Pleistocene and the current Holocene age rocks. The
expansion of the Pleistocene series is found in the upper valleys of Jhelum in Kashmir,
Ganga, Brajhmaputra, Narmada, Tapi, Mahanadi, Godavari and Krishna.
 During Pleistocene period, the entire Kashmir Valley was a lake. Due to endogenetic
forces, the lake drained through Baramullah gorge leaving lacustrine deposits called
Karewas. These rocks are useful for the cultivation of Zafran (a local variety of saffron),
almonds and walnut.

6. Climatic Regions of India
Climatic Condition
Climate is long term pattern of weather in a particular area or it is also defined as the average
atmospheric conditions of a particular region over a considerable time period, usually taken over
35 years.
Weather is short term (minutes to months) change in the atmosphere. It includes sunshine, rain
,cloud cover, wind, hail, snow, sleet etc.
Koppen’s Classification
The most widely used classification of climate is the empirical climate classification scheme
developed by V. Koeppen. Koeppen identified a close relationship between the distribution of
vegetation and climate.He selected certain values of temperature and precipitation and related
them to the distribution of vegetation and used these values for classifying the climates. Koeppen
recognised five major climatic groups, four of them are based on temperature and one on
precipitation.
Group Characteristics
A- Tropical The average temperature
of the coldest month is
18° C or higher
B- Dry

7. Indian Monsoon
Monsoon
The word monsoon originates from the Arabic word mausim which connotes the climate
associated with seasonal reversal in the direction of winds. The Arabian geographer Al Masoodi
was the first to study monsoon.
Indian Monsoon is the most prominent example of the world’s monsoon system, which primarily
affects season, vegetation and lifestyle of the country. The monsoons are seasonal wind which
blows from south-west during summers and reverse its direction during cooler month.
Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
The Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone or ITCZ is a belt of low pressure which encircles the
earth generally near the equator
where the trade winds of northern
and southern hemispheres
converge. It is characterised by
convective activity which often
generates vigorous thunderstorms
over large area. It is most active
over continental land masses and
least over the oceans.
Trade wind
Trade winds blow steadly
towards the equator from the
north-east in the northern
hemisphere and from the south-
east in the southern
hemisphere. These winds blow between 5° to 30° N and S latitude.
26
Impact of Coriolis force
 An apparent (rather than real) force which cases the deflection of moving objects,
especially of air streams, due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis.
 It shows up, for example in the movement of an air stream, relatives to the rotating Earth
beneath it. Because of Coriolis force, all the wind are deflected towards right in
northern hemisphere and towards left in southern hemisphere.
Onset of Monsoon
1. ITCZ shifts towards northward and hence South-East trade winds began to cross
equator.
2. Tibetan plateau absorbs and radiates heat that is to the development of anticyclonic
conditions. The out flow above this plateau moves over north-east India as Tropical
Easterly Jet.
3. Low pressure development over entire north India.
 With the heating of Tibetan plateau, the sub-tropical jet stream suddenly changes its
course to the north of Tibetan highland (due to anticyclonic ridge).
27
 In June, these easterly Jets get firmly established. Also pressure gradient (or low
pressure) attracts the wind blowing from different direction to fill the intense low
pressure over north India. South-East trade wind after crossing the equator, deflect
towards right (because of coriolis effect) and moves toward low pressure (Monsoon
trough) region as South-West Monsoon.
 In June, easterly jet streams flows in southern part of peninsular India with 90 km/h
velocity of wind. The presence of easterly jet stream intensifies the over the surface.
Its subsidence over the Mascarene Island increases the high pressure condition over
sub-tropical high pressure belt. The position of Easterly jet controls the location
of monsoonal rains.
 The south westerly winds are very strong and humid (as they carry moisture from
Arabian Sea) before reaching the Malabar Coast (southern portion of Western
Ghats). These unstable winds than brings around 80% humidity, causing sudden and
heavy rainfall with thunder and lighting. This sudden phenomena is known as Burst
of Monsoon.
Branches of South – West Monsoon
Branches of South-West
Monsoon
Arabian Sea Branches Bay of Bengal Branch
Arabian Sea Branch
Monsoon winds originating from the Arabian Sea are further divided into there sub-branches:
Its one branch is obstructed by the Western Ghats. It climbs 900-1,200 meter above the slope of
the entire Western Ghats. Therefore, these winds immediately cool down along the hillsides of
Sahyadri and causes heavy rainfall (between 250-400 cm) in the western coasteal plains
28
After crossing the Western Ghats, this wind descends and begins to which reduces the humidity
of these winds. As a result, this area receives less rainfall and is known as rain-shadow region
(leeward side to the east of the Western Ghats.
The second branch of the monsoon that arises from the Arabian Sea causes rainfall far in Central
India through the valleys of Narmada and Tapi rivers to the north of Mumbai. The Chotanagpur
Plateau receives 15 cm rainfall from this branch where it enters the Gangetic plain and meets the
Bay of Bengal branch.
The third branch of this monsoon strikes the Saurashtra Peninsula and Kutch region from where
it crosses western Rajasthan moving parallel to Aravallis and cause very little rainfall.
Bay of Bengal Branch
Monsoon winds of the Bay of Bengal branch strikes along the coast of Myanmar and
southeastern Bangladesh. The Arakan Mountains located in Myanmar deflects a large part of this
branch towards the Indian subcontinent.
Thus, the monsoon enters from south and southeast direction (rather than south west direction) in
West Bengal and Bangladesh. One branch moves along the Gangetic plains and reaches the
Punjab plains.
Its second branch goes towards the north-east of the Brahmaputra valley. This branch causes rain
in the extensive area and its other sub-branch causes rain in Mawsynram. It receives highest
annual rainfall in the world located in the Garo hills of Meghalaya.
During south-west monsoon period, after having rainfall for few days, if rain fails to occur
for one or more weeks, it is known as Breaks in the Monsoon.
Retreat of Monsoon
By first week of September with apparent shift of sun towards south, ITCZ also shifts to the
south, as a result of which Tibetan plateau starts cooling which ultimately results into weakening
and disappearance of easterly jet stream.
In the sub tropical region of Himalayas, the jet stream get bifurcated into tow branch of which
one flows to north of Himalayas and southern branch flows along the foot-hills of Shiwaliks.
These branches flow over Bay of Bengal and pick up moisture and cause rainfall along the
Coromandle Coast as North-East Monsoon.
29
Seasons in India
The Cold Weather Season (winter)
 The cold weather season begins from mid- November in northern India and stays till
February. December and January are the coldest months in the northern part of India.
 The temperature decreases from south to the north. The average temperature of Chennai,
on the eastern coast, is between 24° – 25° Celsius, while in the northern plains, it ranges
between 10° – 15° Celsius.
 Days are warm and nights are cold. Frost is common in the north and the higher slopes
of the Himalayas experience snowfall.
 During this season, the northeast trade winds prevail over the country.
 They blow from land to sea and hence, for most part of the country, it is a dry season.
Some amount of rainfall occurs on the Tamil Nadu coast from these winds as, here they
blow from sea to land.
 In the northern part of the country, a feeble high-pressure region develops, with light
winds moving outwards from this area.
 Influenced by the relief, these winds blow through the Ganga valley from the west and
the northwest.
 The weather is normally marked by clear sky, low temperatures and low humidity and
feeble, variable winds.
 A characteristic feature of the cold weather season over the northern plains is the inflow
of cyclonic disturbances from the west and the northwest.
 These low-pressure systems, originate over the Mediterranean Sea and western Asia and
move into India, along with the westerly flow.
 They cause the much-needed winter rains over the plains and snowfall in the mountains.
 Although the total amount of winter rainfall locally known as ‘mahawat’ is small, they
are of immense importance for the cultivation of ‘rabi’ crops. The peninsular region does
not have a well-defined cold season.
 There is hardly any noticeable seasonal change in temperature pattern during winters due
to the moderating influence of the sea.
30
The Hot Weather Season (Summer)
 Due to the apparent northward movement of the sun, the global heat belt shifts
northward.
 As such, from March to May, it is hot weather season in India.
 The influence of the shifting of the heat belt can be seen clearly from temperature
recordings taken during March-May at different latitudes.
 In March, the highest temperature is about 38° Celsius, recorded on the Deccan plateau.
In April, temperatures in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are around 42° Celsius.
 In May, temperature of 45° Celsius is common in the northwestern parts of the country.
 In peninsular India, temperatures remain lower due to the moderating influence of the
oceans
 The summer months experience rising temperature and falling air pressure in the northern
part of the country.
 Towards the end of May, an elongated low-pressure area develops in the region
extending from the Thar Desert in the northwest to Patna and Chotanagpur plateau in the
east and southeast.
 Circulation of air begins to set in around this trogh.
 A striking feature of the hot weather season is the ‘loo’. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry
winds blowing during the day over the north and northwestern India. Sometimes they
even continue until late in the evening.
 Direct exposure to these winds may even prove to be fatal Dust storms are very common
during the month of May in northern India. THE SEASONS OF INDIA
 These storms bring temporary relief as they lower the temperature and may bring light
rain and cool breeze
 This is also the season for localised thunderstorms, associated with violent winds,
torrential downpours, often accompanied by hail.
 In West Bengal, these storms are known as the ‘Kaal Baisakhi’.
 Towards the close of the summer season, pre-monsoon showers are common especially,
in Kerala and Karnatka. They help in the early ripening of mangoes, and are often
referred to as ‘mango showers’.
31
The Rainy Season
 By early June, the low-pressure condition over the northern plains intensifies.
 It attracts, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere. These south-east trade winds
originate over the warm subtropical areas of the southern oceans.
 They cross the equator and blow in a south westerly direction entering the Indian
peninsula as the south-west monsoon. As these winds blow over warm oceans, they bring
abundant moisture to the subcontinent.
 These winds are strong and blow at an average velocity of 30 km per hour.
 With the exception of the extreme north-west, the monsoon winds cover the country in
about a month.
 The inflow of the south-west monsoon into India brings about a total change in the
weather.
 Early in the season, the windward side of the Western Ghats receives very heavy rainfall,
more than 250cm.
 The Deccan Plateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also receive some amount of rain in
spite of lying in the rain shadow area.
 The maximum rainfall of this season is received in the north-eastern part of the country
Mawsynram in the southern ranges of the Khasi Hills receives the highest average
rainfall in the world.
Retreating/Post Monsoons (The Transition Season)
 During October-November, with the apparent movement of the sun towards the south, the
monsoon trough or the low-pressure trough over the northern plains becomes weaker.
 This is gradually replaced by a high-pressure system. The south-west monsoon winds
weaken and start withdrawing gradually. By the beginning of October, the monsoon
withdraws from the Northern Plains.
 The months of October-November form a period of transition from hot rainy season to
dry winter conditions.
 The retreat of the monsoon is marked by clear skies and rise in temperature. While day
temperatures are high, nights are cool and pleasant. The land is still moist.
 Owing to the conditions of high temperature and humidity, the weather becomes rather
oppressive during the day aka ‘October heat’. THE SEASONS OF INDIA
32
 In the second half of October, the mercury begins to fall rapidly in northern India.
 The low-pressure conditions, over northwestern India, get transferred to the Bay of
Bengal by early November
 This shift is associated with the occurrence of cyclonic depressions, which originate over
the Andaman Sea.
 These cyclones generally cross the eastern coasts of India cause heavy and widespread
rain.
 These tropical cyclones are often very destructive. The thickly populated deltas of the
Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri are frequently struck by cyclones, which cause
great damage to life and property.
Sometimes, these cyclones arrive at the coasts of Orissa, West Bengal and Bangladesh.
The bulk of the rainfall of the Coromandel Coast is derived from depressions and cyclones.
Transitional seasons
 Spring: During winter to summer (onset of monsoon)
 Autumn: Summer to winter ( withdrawl of monsoon)
33
8. Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)
 The SOI is an index of the difference of air pressure
El Nino La Nina
 Trade winds weaken during EI Nino
and eastward movement of water
is seen.
 During La Nina, strong Pacific trade
winds blow from the surface water of
westward alignment.
 During El-Nino, their occurs
warming of the Peruvian current
which lowers the pressure gradient.
 During La-Nina, the cold water rises to
the surface & intensifies the high
pressure along the Peruvian coast.
 It weakens the Indian monsoon.  It strengthens the Indian monsoon.
 El-Nino occurs after 3 to 5 years.  This occurs roughly half as often as El-
Nino. It lasts for 1-3 years.

9. Western Disturbances
Western cyclonic disturbances
Western cyclonic disturbances are the temperate cyclones which originate over
Mediterranean Sea and Western Asia. It moves towards India along with the westerly jet
streams.
By causing cyclonic rains over the plains and snowfall in the mountains, they disturv the weather
of north and north-west India.
Winter rainfall caused by them is known as Mahawat in Rajasthan and is immensely important
for the cultivation of Rabi corps.
Winter Rainfall in North-West Region
It is caused due to western disturbances occurring in Mediterrenean sea, which gets dragged
to India by Sub-tropical Westerly Jet Stream. This winter precipitation is highly beneficial for
Rabi Corps grown in region and for feeding Himalayan glaciers.
Local Winds during Summer
Winds which are caused by local factors and confined to a limited area compared to planetary
winds are called as local winds.
Norwesters
In West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Assam direction of local winds in summer is from
North west, hence are known as Norwesters.
Kalbaisakhi is a strong wind which blows during the Baisakh Season in Assam and West
Bengal in the evening. It is beneficial for the crops like tea, jute, rice etc.
In Assam, it is known as Bardoli Chheerha.
35
Loo
Loo winds are strong, hot and dry summer afternoon wind from the west which blows over the
western Indo-Gangetic Plain region of North India and Pakistan. It is especially strong in the
months of May and June.
During summer, desert regions of South Balochistan and Thar desert in India gets heated up to a
greater extent. This creates a vast low pressure area over North Indian plains during afternoon.
This low pressure area pulls in moist air from North Arabian sea. When this air mass blows over
Gujarat region it loses its moisture to the parched land and becomes dry.
Pre Monsoon Shower
During March-April, sun’s apparent movement towards north causes rise in temperature in
North India. This local heating causes conventional rise in air thereby causing heavy rain
accompanied with thunder and lightning which is knonw as pre monsoon shower.
36
10. Mango Shower & Cherry Blossom Rain
Mango Shower
Mango Shower or Mango Rain is a colloquial term to describe the occurrence of pre-monsoon
rainfall. Sometimes, these rains are referred to as April Rains or Summer Showers. These
occur across south and southeast Asia including India in Kerala and Karnataka.
Between Port Darwin of Australia and Tahiti of French Polynesia. In an El-Nino year, when
a warm current develops along the Peru coast, the value of the Southern Oscillation Index
becomes negative.
The Walker Circulation is caused by the pressure gradient force which results from a high
pressure system over the eastern Pacific Ocean and low pressure system over Indonesia.
Locally it is known as Mango Shower or Mango Rain because it is beneficial for mango trees.
These rain normally occur from March to April, although their arrival is often difficult predict.
Cherry Blossom Rain
Due to this rainfall, coffee flowers blossom in Kerala and nearby areas. So, it is termed as
Flower Rain or Cherry Blossom in Karnataka.
Traditional Season in India
 Spring Chaitra-Baisakh March-April
 Summer Jyesth-Ashadh May-June
 Rain Shravan-Bhadrapad July-August
 Autumn Ashwin-Kartika September-October
 Winter Margshirsh-Paush November-December
 Cold-Winter Magh-Falgun January-Feb.
37
Cloud
 Cloud is a mass of minute water droplets or tine crystals of ice formed by the
condensation of the water vapour in free air at considerable elevations.
 According to their height, expanse, density and transparency or opaqueness clouds
are grouped under four types.

as general overcast
VERTICAL 9. Cumulus (Cs)
10. Cumulonimbus Tall, narrow, puffy
Precipitation comes from clouds that have nimb in their name eg. Nimbo stratus, (develop
from stratus could), Cumulonimbus (develop from cumulus cloud).

11. Drainage System of India
The flow of water through well-defined channels is known as drainage and the network of such
channels is called a “drainage system”. The drainage system of an area is the outcome of the
geological time period, nature and structure of rocks, slope, topography, amount of water
flowing and the periodicity of flow. The area drained by a single river system (river and its
tributaries) is called its drainage basin. An elevated area (mountain or upland) that separates two
drainage basins is called a “water divide”. The world’s largest drainage basin is of the Amazon
river and in India, the river Ganga has the largest river basin.
Important Points
 An area drained by a river and its tributaries is called a drainage basin. The boundary line
separating one drainage basin from the other is known as the watershed.
 The flow of water through well defined channels is known as drainage and the network of
such channel drainage
system.
 The catchments of large
rivers are called river
basins while those of
small rivulets and rills
are often referred to as
watersheds.
 On the basis of the
mode of origin, nature
and characteristics, the
Indian drainage may
also be classified into
the Himalayan drainage
and the peninsular
drainage.
 There are more than 4,
000 small and big rivers
in India which are
divided into 23 large
and 200 small river
basins.

12. Types of Discordant Drainage Pattern
Antecedent Drainage
The drainage pattern formed by the rivers that maintain their original course and pattern despite
the changes in underlying rock topography is known as Antecedent Drainage. The soil formed is
weak and is easily eroded by the rivers. Example: Indus and Ganga drainage river.
Superimposed Drainage
This type of drainage pattern cuts deeper through the existing landform and maintains its original
course. Some medium scale rivers of the northern and eastern peninsular India are its examples.
Concordant Drainage Pattern
In a concordant drainage pattern, the path of the river is highly dependent on the slope of the
river and topography.
Dendritic or Pinnate Drainage Pattern
The drainage pattern resembling the branches of a tree is known as dendritic, the examples of
which are the rivers of northern plains.
Example: Indus, Godavari, Mahanadi, Cauvery, Krishna.
Trellis Drainage Pattern
In this type of pattern the short subsequent streams meet the main stream at right angles and
differential erosion through soft rocks paves the way for tributaries.
Examples: The old fold mountains of the Singhbhum (Chotanagpur Plateau).
Angular Drainage Pattern
 The tributaries join the main stream at acute angels.
 This pattern is common in Himalayan Foothill Regions.
Rectangular Drainage Pattern
 The main stream bends at right angles and the tributaries join at right angles creating
rectangular patterns.
40
 Streams found in the Vindhyan Mountain of India.
Radial Drainage Pattern
 The tributaries from a summit follow the slope downwards and drain down in all
directions.
 A good example of a radial drainage pattern is provided by the rivers originating from the
Amarkantak plateau. River like Narmada, Son and Mahanadi originating from
Amarkantak Hills.
 Radial drainage pattern are also found in the Girnar Hills (Kathiawar, Gujarat) and Mikir
Hills of Assam.
Annular Drainage Pattern
 When the upland has an outer soft stratum, the radial streams develop subsequent
tributaries which try to follow a circular drainage around the summit.
 Some examples of this are however found in Pithoragargh (Uttarakhand), Nilgiri Hills
in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
Parallel Drainage Pattern
 The tributaries seem to be running parallel to each other in a uniformly sloping region.
Example: Rivers of lesser Himalayas, the small and swift rivers originating in the
Western Ghats that flow into Arabian Sea.
Centripetal Drainage Pattern
 In a low lying basin the streams converge from all sides forming centripetal patter.
 Examples: stream of Ladakh, Tibet the Baghmati ant its tributaries Nepal.
Deranged Drainage Pattern
 This is an uncoordinated pattern of drainage characteristic of a region recently vacated by
an ice-sheet.
 This type of drainage is found in the glaciated valley of Karakoram.
Barbed Drainage Pattern
 A pattern of drainage in which the confluence of a tributary with the main river is
characterized by a discordant junction when the tributaries flow in opposite direction to
their master stream.
41
 The Arun River (Nepal), a tributary of the Kosi is an interesting example of barbed
drainage pattern.
Consequent Rivers
 The rivers which follow the general direction of slope are known as the consequent
rivers they are also called dipstreams. Most of the rivers of peninsular India are
consequent rivers.
 Example: river like Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery.
Subsequent Rivers

Waterfalls are a spectacular sight to many eyes. Who would not like water crashing from
tremendous heights and making plunge pools below it. India is home to most beautiful waterfalls
in the world. Here monsoons are the major water providers to many waterfalls. The rains power
the rivers and they create gushing waterfalls that become the ultimate travel destination every
year. Take a look at such waterfalls in India below.

18. Soil Types
 Soil is the network of interacting living organisms within the earth’s surface layer which
support life above ground. It is a thin upper weathered layer of the earth crust. The major
constituents of the soil are minerals, humus, water and air.
 The naturally occurring soil is influenced by (i) parent material, (ii) climate, (iii) physical,
chemical and biological agents (micro-organism) in it, (iv) land use practices and (v)
time.
 Paedogenesis is the natural process of soil formation. It includes various subsidiary
processes such as humiliation, weathering, leaching and calcification. Pedology is the
study of soils in their natural environment. It deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology
and soil classification.
 Soil develops where rock and sediments (lithosphere) are influenced by flora and fauna
(biosphere), water (hydrosphere) and climate (atmosphere).

The World Soil Day is celebrated every year on h December by Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. It aims to communicate messages on the
importance of soil quality for food security, health ecosystems and human well-being. Keep
soil alive protect soil biodiversity-is the theme for 2020.

20. Layers of Soil
Definition of Soil
Soil can be simply defined as a mixture of small rock particles/debris and organic materials/
humus which develop on the earth surface and support growth of plants.
Karewas Soils
 Lacustrine deposits, formed during the Pleistocene period due to endogenetic forces, in
the valleys of Kashmir and Bhadarwah in Doda district of Jammu are known as Karewas.
 These are the flat topped mounds, composed of fine salt clay, sand and boulder-clay.
 The Karewas are very fertile deposits and are used for the cultivation of Saffron,
almonds, Walnuts, Apple and Orchards.

56
Laterization
 It is common to the soils found in the humid tropical and subtropical environments.
 The high temperatures and heavy precipitation results in the rapid weathering of rocks
and minerals.
 Almost all of the by-products of weathering are translocated from A horizon to B horizon
by leaching.
 The B-Horizon in a lateritic soil has high concentration of illuviated materials. Heavy
leaching causes the soils to have an acidic pH because of the net loss of base captions.
 This type of soil is known as Laterite which means brick-like as it used in tropical areas
for making bricks.
Calcification
 It occurs when evapotranspiration exceeds precipitations causing the upward movement
of dissolved alkaline salts from the groundwater. It occurs in warm, semi-arid
environment.
 In some cases, the deposits can form a hard layer called Caliche. The most common
substance involved in this process is Calcium Carbonate.
Podsolisation
 It occurs in cool and moist climates.
 It occurs when strongly acid soil solutions cause the breakdown of clay minerals. As a
result Silica, Aluminium and Iron from complexes with organic substances in the soil.
Snowfields
 The areas under snow and glaciers are collectively known as snowfields. The high peaks
of the Greater Himalayas are Karakoram, Ladakh and Zaskar.
 The soils in these areas are immature, generally without soil erosion. They remain frozen
and are unsuitable for the cultivation of crops.
57
Gleying
 It occurs in waterlogged, anaerobic conditions when iron compounds are either reduced
or removed from the soil, or segregated out as mottles or concretions in the soils. A
 The removal of iron leaves the soil a grey or bluish colour. Marshy wetlands often
contain gleyed soils.
Salinization
 It is the process of accumulation of salts, such as sulphates and Chlorides of Calcium,
Magnesium, Sodium and Potassium, in soils in the form of a salty horizon.
 It is quite common in arid and semi-arid regions.
International Year of Soils
The International Year of Soils, 2015 (IYS 2015) was declared by the sixty-eighth session of the

21 Classification of Forest Based on Administration
Statutary Conditions
I. Reserved Forest: In these forests, entry of people is prohibited for the collection of
timber and grazing of cattle. A total of 53%of forest area of the country fall under
this category.
II. Protected Forest: These forests are under the supervision of the government but
local people have the right to collect wood for fuel and feed the cattle in this region,
but provided there should be no serious threat to forests. A total of 29% the
country’s forest areas belong to this category.
III. Unclassified Forest: There is no restriction on cutting trees and feeding cattle in
unclassified forest. About 18% forest area of the country falls under this category.
Classification of Forests
Tropical Evergreen Forests
 These forests are found in areas receiving more than 200 cm of rainfall and having
temperature above 22°C.
 Tropical Evergreen Forests are found in Sahyadri (Western Ghats), Shillong Plateau,
Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep.

 These forests are dense and multi-layered. It harbours many types of plants and animals.
The trees are evergreen as there is no definite period to shed their leaves.
 The semi evergreen forests are found in the less rainy parts of these regions. Such forests
have a mixture of evergreen and moist deciduous trees.
 The forests are also important for the cultivation of spices.
Tropical Wet Deciduous Forests
 These are also called as Monsoon forests. These forests are found in the parts of
Chhattisgarh. Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil
Nadu.
 Moist Deciduous forests are found in the area with100-200 cm of rainfall. The major
regions include western slopes of Sahyadri, north-eastern parts of peninsular plateau,
Bhabar and Terai Region along the foothills of Shiwaliks.
 The major vegetation of these forests includes Teak, Sal, Mango, Mahua, Bamboo,
Shisham, Khair and sandal. All these are economically very important.
 Dry Deciduous forests are found in the regions with 70-100 cm of rainfall. These
represent transition type as on the wetter side these gives way to moist deciduous and on
the drier side these become thorn forests.
 Trees of these forests have thick bark and are not very high (generally 6-9 m height).
 They are distributed in eastern Rajasthan, western Madhya Pradesh, south-western Uttar
Pradesh, southern Punjab, Haryana and the rain shadow region of Western Ghats.
 Overgrazing is the most important problem in these forests. the vegetation of this region
includes Mahua, Babool, Tendu, Khair, Pepal etc.
Tropical Thorn Forests
 These forests are found in the areas with rainfall less than 75 cm, humidity less than 50%
and high temperature around 25-30°C.
 These forests are also found in a crescent belt extending from Indore district of Madhya
Pradesh to plateau regions of Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh.
 The main species of these forests are Babool, Khair, Palm, Date, Cacti and Palas.
The vegetation of these forests includes Mahogany, Rosewood, Bamboo, Canes, Cinchona, and Rubber etc.
60
Montane Forests
 Since climatic conditions change with increasing height, the change in vegetation cover
at different heights in mountainous region is also observed.
 Here the vegetation ranges from tropical to alpine type. At an altitude of 1500 m
deciduous forest are found while the altitude of coniferous forest various from 1500-
3000.
 The vegetation found here includes Deodar, Spruce, Silver fir, Chir etc whose leaves are
conical.
 Broad leaf evergreen trees like Oak, Magnolia, Lawrell etc are found in the heavy rainfall
regiions of the eastern Himalayas.
Littoral and Swamp Forests
 These forests are also called Tidal or Mangrove.
 The deltaic tracts of Ganga, Godavari, and Krishna etc are ideally suited for this type of
forests.
 The best example of this type of forest is Sunderbans which is the largest mangrove
forest of the world.
Van Mahotsav was launched in 1950 to make people aware of the importance of planting trees.
Van Mahotsav is usually observed in the first week of July every year. The objective is to keep
local people involved in plantation drives and spread environmental awareness.
 The United Nations General Assembly declared 21 March as the international day of Forests
(IDF), in 2012.
 The theme for each International Day of Forests is chosen by the collaborative partnership on
forests. The theme for 2021 is Forest Restoration: A path to Recovery and Well Being.

23. Biodiversity and Wildlife
 India is characterised as a megadiverse country which accounts for 2.4% of the total
world’s area, harbouring a rich diversity of geographical flora and fauna.
 The country’s diverse physical features and climatic conditions have resulted in a variety
of ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, grasslands, and deserts etc. which harbour and
sustain a high level of biodiversity.
 According to Conservation International, 4 out of 35 globally identified biodiversity
hotspots are found in India.
Biodiversity Hotspots
 Biodiversity means variety and variability of life on earth including terrestrial, marine
and other aquatic ecosystem.
Biome
 Biome is a community of flora and fauna that have common characteristics for the
environment in they exist and no two biomes are alike.
 There are 10 different bio-geographic zones and 25 bio-geographic provinces in India.

endangered species, breed variety, plant or animal are conserved outside their natural
habitats.
 In-Situ conservation is on-site conservation of plants and animals within their natural
habitats or in protected areas.

24. Protected Areas
India is one of the 17 mega diverse countries of the world. With only 2.4% of the world’s land
area, 16.7% of the world’s human population and 18% livestock, it contributes about 8% of the
known global biodiversity, however, putting enormous demands on our natural resources. India
is home to world’s largest wild tigers population and has got unique assemblage of globally
important endangered species like Asiatic lion, Asian Elephant, One-horned Rhinoceros,
Gangetic River Dolphin, Snow Leopard, Kashmir Stag, Dugong, Gharial, Great Indian Bustard,
Lion Tailed Macaque etc.
Protected Area Network in India:
A National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), chaired by the Prime Minister of India provides for
policy framework for wildlife conservation in the country. The National Wildlife Action Plan
(2002-2016) was adopted in 2002, emphasizing the people’s participation and their support for
wildlife conservation. India’s conservation planning is based on the philosophy of identifying
and protecting representative wild habitats across all the ecosystems. The Indian Constitution
entails the subject of forests and wildlife in the Concurrent list. The Federal Ministry acts as a
guiding torch dealing with the policies and planning on wildlife conservation, while the
provincial Forest Departments are vested with the responsibility of implementation of national
policies and plans.
A network of 668 Protected Areas (PAs) has been established, extending over 1,61,221.57 sq.
kms. (4.90% of total geographic area), comprising 102 National Parks, 515 Wildlife Sanctuaries,
47 Conservation Reserves and 4 Community Reserves. The State/Union Territory wise details of
PAs in the country with year of notification and area is given at Annexure-I. 39 Tiger Reserves
(Annexure-II) and 28 Elephant Reserves (Annexure-III) have been designated for species
specific management of tiger and elephant habitats. UNESCO has designated 5 Protected Areas
as World Heritage Sites. As the ecosystems and species do not recognise political borders, the
concept of Transboundary Protected Areas has been initiated for coordinated conservation of
ecological units and corridors with bilateral and/or multilateral cooperation of the neighbouring
nations. There are 4 categories of the Protected Areas viz, National Parks,
67
National Park
National Park is an area having adequate ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural or
zoological significance. The National Park is declared for the purpose of protecting, propagating
or developing wildlife or its environment, like that of a Sanctuary. The difference between a
Sanctuary and a National Park mainly lies in the vesting of rights of people living inside. Unlike
a Sanctuary, where certain rights can be allowed, in a National Park, no rights are allowed. No
grazing of any livestock shall also be permitted inside a National Park while in a Sanctuary, the
Chief Wildlife Warden may regulate, control or prohibit it. In addition, while any removal or
exploitation of wildlife or forest produce from a Sanctuary requires the recommendation of the
State Board for Wildlife, removal etc., from a National Park requires recommendation of the
National Board for Wildlife (However, as per orders of Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 9th May
2002 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 337 of 1995, such removal/ exploitation from a Sanctuary also
requires recommendation of the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife).
Sanctuaries
Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves and Community Reserves. Sanctuary is an area which is of
adequate ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural or zoological significance. The
Sanctuary is declared for the purpose of protecting, propagating or developing wildlife or its
environment. Certain rights of people living inside the Sanctuary could be permitted. Further,
during the settlement of claims, before finally notifying the Sanctuary, the Collector may, in
consultation with the Chief Wildlife Warden, allow the continuation of any right of any person in
or over any land within the limits of the Sanctuary.
Conservation Reserves
Conservation Reserves can be declared by the State Governments in any area owned by the
Government, particularly the areas adjacent to National Parks and Sanctuaries and those areas
Protected Areas
National Park Wildlife Sanctuary Biosphere Reserve
68
which link one Protected Area with another. Such declaration should be made after having
consultations with the local communities.
Conservation Reserves are declared for the purpose of protecting landscapes, seascapes, flora
and fauna and their habitat. The rights of people living inside a Conservation Reserve are not
affected. Community Reserves can be declared by the State Government in any private or
community land, not comprised within a National Park, Sanctuary or a Conservation Reserve,
where an individual or a community has volunteered to conserve wildlife and its habitat.
Community Reserves are declared for the purpose of protecting fauna, flora and traditional or
cultural conservation values and practices. As in the case of a Conservation Reserve, the rights of
people living inside a Community Reserve are not affected.
Regulations/ laws relating to Protected Areas (PAs):
The PAs are constituted and governed under the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act,
1972, which has been amended from time to time, with the changing ground realities concerning
wildlife crime control and PAs management. Implementation of this Act is further
complemented by other Acts viz. Indian Forest Act, 1927, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980,
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Biological Diversity Act, 2002 and the Scheduled
Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. The
Wildlife Crime Control Bureau of the Central Government supplements the efforts of provincial
governments in wildlife crime control through enforcement of CITES and control of wildlife
crimes having cross-border, interstate and international ramifications. In order to strengthen and
synergise global wildlife conservation efforts, India is a party to major international conventions
viz. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITES),
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), International Convention for the
Regulation of Whaling, UNESCO-World Heritage Committee and Convention on Migratory
Species (CMS).
Main issues concerning the management of Protected Areas:
Wildlife conservation and management in India is currently facing a myriad of complex
challenges that are both ecological and social in nature. Issues such as habitat loss/fragmentation,
overuse of biomass resources in the context of biotic pressures, increasing human-wildlife
conflicts, livelihood dependence on forests and wildlife resources, poaching and illegal trade in
69
wildlife parts and products, need for maintaining a broad base of public support for wildlife
conservation exemplify and characterize the contemporary wildlife conservation scenario in
India. The government and the civil society are taking several measures to address these issues.
Improved synergies and better coordination amongst the wide array of stakeholders are needed to
meet the challenges of conserving India’s diverse wilderness resources. In 1972, Wildlife
Protection Act was passed under which various wildlife sanctuaries and national parks have been
set up.
 National Parks are habitat oriented, under which protection is given to all species living
in a specific region.
 The largest National Park of India is located in Leh (Ladakh) known as Hemis National
Park.
 The Smallest National Park in India is in South Button Island in Andaman and Nicobar
Islands (0.03 sq. km.)
 Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 provides for the protection of wild animals, birds and
plants. The act contains seven schedules which gives varying degree of protection.
 Schedule I and Part 2 of Schedule II provide absolute protection.
 Madhav Gadgil Committee (2011) and Kasturirangan committee (2013) have
recommendation on Eco-Sensitive Zones in Western Ghats.
 Wildlife Crime Control Bureau is a statutory multidisciplinary body established by the
government of India under the Ministry of Environment and Forrest to combat organised
wildlife crime in the country.
 The Bureau has its headquarter New Delhi and five regional offices at Delhi, Kolkata,
Mumbai, Chennai and Jabalpur.
 It was created on 6 June, 2007 by amending the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
 The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) is an autonomous institution under the Ministry of
Environment, Forest and Climate Change, established in 1982 at Chandrabani, Dehradun
in Uttrakhand.
 Galathea Bay Wildlife Sanctuary (Great Nicobar Island) is one of the most important coastal
and marine biodiversity areas and Marine Turtle Habitat in India.
 India’s first national park was maximum number of national parks (10) followed by Andaman
and Nicobar (9).
 As of 2021, there are 544 W

25. Biosphere Reserves
'Biosphere Reserves' - was initiated under UNESCO's 'Man & Biosphere1 (MAB) programme in
1971. The purpose of its formation is to conserve in situ all forms of life, along with its support
system, in its totality, so that it could serve as a referral system for monitoring and evaluating
changes in natural ecosystems. The first biosphere reserve of the world was established in 1979;
since then, the network of biosphere reserves has increased to 564 in 109 countries across the
world (MAB, 2010). Presently, there are 18 existing biosphere reserves in India. Some of the
famous biosphere reserves are Sunderbans in West Bengal, Khangchendzonga mountain ranges
in Sikkim, Nandnadevi mountain ranges in Uttarakhand, Gulf of Mannar, Rann of Kutch in
Gujarat etc.
Thus, the protected area network plays a significant role in conservation, and regardless of the
country - India or others, where the common aim is to preserve the ecological wealth by
continuing conservation efforts.
Conserving Protected Areas
 Reduce forest-based dependence of locals/tribals living on the forest fringes, by providing
them alternate livelihood options.
 Increased vigilance and patrolling to counter poaching and other crimes
 Increased awareness amongst people and sensitivity towards the last strongholds of our
country that support wildlife.
 Biosphere reserves are terrestrial and coastal/marine ecosystem made to conserve the
biodiversity. These are the sites recognized under UNESCO’S Man and Biosphere (MAB)
programme to promote sustainable development based on local community efforts.
Biosphere Reserves was initiated by UNESCO in 1971.
Core Zone: It contains suitable habitat for numerous plants and animal species including
higher order predators. Core Zone should be kept free from human interference. This is strictly
prohibited area.
71
Buffer Zone: The buffer zone surrounds or adjoins the core areas, and is used for activities
compatible with sound ecological practices which can reinforce scientific research, monitoring,
training and education.
Transition Zone: The transition area is the part of the reserve where his greatest activity is
allowed, fostering economic and human development that is socio-culturally and ecologically
sustainable.
India has 18 Biosphere Reserves and with the inclusion of Panna Biosphere Reserve (MP), in
2020, the number of UNESCO designated World Natural Biosphere Reserves under MAB has
raised to 12.
Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn Convention)
It is the only global convention specializing in conservation of migratory species, their habitats
and migration routes. It came into force in 1983.

26. The International Union for Conservation of Nature
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in full International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, formerly called World Conservation Union,
network of environmental organizations founded as the International Union for the Protection of
Nature in October 1948 in Fontainebleau, France, to promote nature conservation and the
ecologically sustainable use of natural resources. It changed its name to the International Union
for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) in 1956 and was also known as the
World Conservation Union (IUCN) from 1990 to 2008. The IUCN is the world’s oldest global
environmental organization. Its headquarters are in Gland, Switz.
Through its member organizations, the IUCN supports and participates in environmental
scientific research; promotes and helps implement national conservation legislation, policies, and
practices; and operates or manages thousands of field projects worldwide. The IUCN’s activities
are organized into several theme-based programs ranging from business and biodiversity to
forest preservation to water and wetlands conservation. In addition, a smaller number of
special initiatives draw upon the work of different programs to address specific issues, such
as climate change, conservation, and poverty reduction. The volunteer work of more than 10,000
scientists and other experts is coordinated through special commissions on education and
communication; environmental, economic, and social policy; environmental law; ecosystem
management; species survival; and protected areas. All of the IUCN’s work is guided by a global
program, which is adopted by member organizations every four years at the IUCN World
Conservation Congress.
The IUCN maintains the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, a comprehensive assessment of
the current risk of extinction of thousands of plant and animal species. The organization also
publishes or coauthors hundreds of books, reports, and other documents each year. The IUCN
has been granted observer status at the United Nations General Assembly.
The IUCN’s membership includes more than 1,000 governmental and nongovernmental
organizations from more than 140 countries. It is governed by a democratically elected council,
73
which is chosen by member organizations at each World Conservation Congress. The IUCN’s
funding comes from a number of governments, agencies, foundations, member organizations,
and corporations.
India became a state member of IUCN in 1969 and IUCN office was established in New Delhi
(2007).
 The Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITES) is an international agreement between the governments, administered through United
Nation Environment Program (UNEP).
 The World Wide Fund for Nature is an international non-governmental organization
founded on 24 April, 1961, working in the field of Wildlife Preservation and the reduction
of human impact on the environment.
 Its headquarter is located in Gland, Switzerland.

27. Conservation Efforts of Forest and Wildlife in India
Conservation in the background of rapid decline in wildlife population and forestry has become
essential. But why do we need to conserve our forests and wildlife? Conservation preserves the
ecological diversity and our life support systems – water, air and soil. It also preserves the
genetic diversity of plants and animals for better growth of species and breeding. For example, in
agriculture, we are still dependent on traditional crop varieties. Fisheries too are heavily
dependent on the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity. In the 1960s and 1970s, conservationists
demanded a national wildlife protection programme. The Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act was
implemented in 1972, with various provisions for protecting habitats. An all-India list of
protected species was also published. The thrust of the programme was towards protecting the
remaining population of certain endangered species by banning hunting, giving legal protection
to their habitats, and restricting trade in wildlife.
Subsequently, central and many state governments established national parks and wildlife
sanctuaries about which you have already studied. The central government also announced
several projects for protecting specific animals, which were gravely threatened, including the
tiger, the one horned rhinoceros, the Kashmir stag or hangul, three types of crocodiles – fresh
water crocodile, saltwater crocodile and the Gharial, the Asiatic lion, and others. Most recently,
the Indian elephant, black buck (chinkara), the great Indian bustard (godawan) and the snow
leopard, etc. have been given full or partial legal protection against hunting and trade throughout
India.
The conservation projects are now focusing on biodiversity rather than on a few of its
components. There is now a more intensive search for different conservation measures.
Increasingly, even insects are beginning to find a place in conservation planning. In the
notification under Wildlife Act of 1980 and 1986, several hundred butterflies, moths, beetles,
and one dragonfly have been added to the list of protected species. In 1991, for the first time
plants were also added to the list, starting with six species.
75
Types and Distribution of Forest and Wildlife Resources:
Even if we want to conserve our vast forest and wildlife resources, it is rather difficult to
manage, control and regulate them. In India much of its forest and wildlife resources are either
owned or managed by the government through the Forest Department or other government
departments.
These are classified under the following categories.
(i) Reserved Forests: More than half of the total forest land has been declared reserved
forests. Reserved forests are regarded as the most valuable as far as the conservation of
forest and wildlife resources are concerned.
(ii) Protected Forests: Almost one-third of the total forest area is protected forest, as declared
by the Forest Department. This forest land are protected from any further depletion.
(iii) Unclassed Forests: These are other forests and wastelands belonging to both government
and private individuals and communities. Reserved and protected forests are also
referred to as permanent forest estates maintained for the purpose of producing timber
and other forest produce, and for protective reasons.
Madhya Pradesh has the largest area under permanent forests, constituting 75 per cent of its
total forest area. Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West
Bengal, and Maharashtra have large percentages of reserved forests of its total forest area
whereas Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan have a bulk of it
under protected forests. All North-eastern states and parts of Gujarat have a very high
percentage of their forests as unclassed forests managed by local communities.
The Institutional Framework for Wildlife Conservation in India
State Government Institutions:
State governments exercise complete administrative control over all statutorily recognized
forests and other government-owned lands in the country. The state government’s power to
constitute reserved forests, national parks and wildlife sanctuaries is absolute but it has to seek
prior approval of the Central Government for de-reservation, de-notification, diversion, logging,
or leasing of forests for non-forestry activities.
76
Statutory Bodies
Several statutory bodies require to be constituted at the federal and state levels with varying
mandates to enforce, advise, and monitor a wide range of issues concerning forests, wildlife and
environment. Some of the key bodies include the following:
(a) The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) (formerly known as the Indian Board for Wildlife)
is constituted under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and chaired by the Prime Minister with
the Minister of Environment and Forests as the vice-chair. Apart from a number of government
functionaries drawn from both the Central and State governments, five non-governmental
organizations and ten conservationists/ecologists are nominated to the NBWL. The board advises
the federal and state governments in matters concerning wildlife conservation policy, illegal
trade and poaching, management of national parks and sanctuaries, impact assessments of
projects on wildlife, and other related issues. The tenure of each board is 3 years, after which a
new one is constituted.
(The NBWL is ordinarily expected to meet at least once a year, but this does not always happen.
However, a Standing Committee of the NBWL, comprising of a few government and non-
government members of the NBWL, meets every three months under the chairmanship of the
Union Minister of Environment and Forests, primarily to examine proposals for non-forestry use
of forestland within National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries, and issue or deny permissions.
These include, among others, proposals for highways, dams, industries and mining. The
minutes of every Standing Committee meeting are put up on the website of the MoEF).
(b) State Boards for Wildlife at the state level similarly advise the state governments in selection
and management of protected areas and other matters connected with the protection of wildlife.
The SBWL is headed by Chief Minister, with the Forest Minister of the State as the Vice Chair.
(In many states, the SBWL is either totally defunct or simply a rubber stamp. Very often, retired
government officials and ‘nature enthusiasts’ with questionable knowledge and credentials make
up the board, thus making it fairly ineffective).
(c) The Biodiversity Act, 2002 mandates the constitution of a National Biodiversity Authority
which, among other responsibilities, advises the Union and State governments on matters
77
relating to biodiversity conservation, equitable sharing of benefits arising out of biological
resource utilization; regulating access to biodiversity and initiating measures to oppose the
granting of Intellectual Property Rights on any biological resource obtained from India.
(d) Central and State Pollution Control Boards have been constituted under the Environment
Protection Act (EPA), 1986 with wide-ranging powers to regulate the setting up of industries in
Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) and to inspect and prosecute individuals or industries who
violate specified pollution control norms.
(e) The Central Empowered Committee (CEC): initially constituted under the Environment
Protection Act, 1986 for a period of five years, starting in September 2002, it functions as a
Committee of the Supreme Court to assist and monitor compliance of the orders of the Supreme
Court in the major public interest litigation (Writ Petition (Civil) 202/1995 – Godavarman
Tirumalpad v/s Union of India & others) concerning protection of forests, wildlife, and related
issues.
(f) National Green Tribunal (2009): The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is a institution that is
empowered to adjudicate environmental disputes. The tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil
cases where a substantial question relating to the environment – arising out of the
implementation of the Environment Protection Act, Forest Conservation Act, Biodiversity Act,
Water (Prevention and control of pollution) Act, and related laws – is involved. The National
Green Tribunal is intended to drive effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to
environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources, including
enforcement of any legal right relating to environment, and giving relief and compensation for
damages to persons and property and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
(g) Forest Advisory Committee (FAC): Is a statutory committee constituted under Section 3 of
the Forest Conservation Act to consider proposals for diversion of forestland (other than in
National Parks or Sanctuaries) for non-forestry purposes, and render advice to the Central
Government.

28. Wetlands and Ramsar Conservation
Wetlands are defined as area of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial,
permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including
areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide should not exceed six metres.
Wetlands in India
Globally, wetlands cover 6.4 per cent of the geographical area of the world. In India, according
to the National Wetland Inventory and Assessment compiled by the Indian Space Research
Organisation (ISRO), wetlands are spread over 1,52,600 square kilometres (sq km) which is 4.63
per cent of the total geographical area of the country. Of the 1,52,600 sq km, inland-natural
wetlands account for 43.4% and coastal-natural wetlands 24.3%. Rivers/streams occupy 52,600
sq km, reservoirs/barrages 24,800 sq km, inter-tidal mudflats 24,100 sq km, tanks/ponds 13,100
sq km and lake/ponds 7300 sq km. India has 19 types of wetlands. In state-wise distribution of
wetlands, Gujarat is at the top with 34,700 sq km (17.56 percent of total geographical area of the
state), or 22.7 percent of total wetlands areas of the country thanks to a long coastline. It is
followed by Andhra Pradesh (14,500 sq km), Uttar Pradesh (12,400 sq km) and West Bengal
(11,100 sq km).
In India, peatlands have been recorded in Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, and
north Sikkim. Some parts of the Western Ghats have peat too. A lot of our deltas and mangroves
have the propensity to develop into peat
Types of Wetlands
 Coastal Wetlands: Coastal wetlands are found in the areas between land and open sea
that are not influenced by rivers such as shorelines, beaches, mangroves and coral reefs.
 A good example is the mangrove swamps found in sheltered tropical coastal areas.
 Shallow lakes and ponds: These wetlands are areas of permanent or semi-permanent
water with little flow. They include vernal ponds, spring pools, salt lakes and volcanic
crater lakes.
88
 Marshes: These are periodically saturated, flooded, or ponded with water and
characterized by herbaceous (non-woody) vegetation adapted to wet soil conditions.
Marshes are further characterized as tidal marshes and non-tidal marshes.
 Swamps: These are fed primarily by surface water inputs and are dominated by trees and
shrubs. Swamps occur in either freshwater or saltwater floodplains.
 Bogs: Bogs are waterlogged peatlands in old lake basins or depressions in the landscape.
Almost all water in bogs comes from rainfall.
 Estuaries: The area where rivers meet the sea and water changes from fresh to salt can
offer an extremely rich mix of biodiversity. These wetlands include deltas, tidal
mudflats and salt marshes.
Why are wetlands important?
Wetlands are vital not only for the ecosystems but our climate, providing essential services
such as water regulation, flood control, and water purification. Wetland biodiversity is
significant for ensuring good health, food supply, picturesque views facilitating tourism and
thus related jobs.
Wetlands are also capable of absorbing carbon dioxide, therefore reducing global heating and
pollution, and are often referred to as the “Kidneys of the Earth”.
Wetlands provide a wide range of important resources and ecosystem services such as food,
water, fibre, groundwater recharge, water purification, flood moderation, erosion control, and
climate regulation. They are a major source of water and the main supply of fresh water
comes from an array of wetlands which help soak rainfall and recharge groundwater.
Wetlands are also important for the survival of floral and fauna. Several threatened migratory
birds come to Indian wetlands. It provides wintering ground to migratory waterbirds such as
the endangered Pallas’s fish-Eagle, the vulnerable Common Pochard, and the near-threatened
Dalmatian Pelican, Grey-headed Fish-eagle, and Ferruginous Duck.
The Wetland Project
The Wetlands of India portal has been developed under a technical cooperation project
“Wetlands Management for Biodiversity and Climate Protection” (Wetlands Project) of the
89
Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in partnership with
Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.
Similarly, India has been taking several wetland conservation projects to restore and protect
the important wetlands in India that are the basis of living for many.
4-pronged rejuvenation of wetlands projects: The Ministry of Environment, forests, and
climate undertook the restoration and rejuvenation of 130 wetlands under a four-pronged
strategy, in which the nodal officers of these wetlands were trained in preparing focused
management plans and in working out the health of the wetland. For the first time in the
country, wetlands were graded between A to E as per their health.
Ramsar Conservation
It is an intergovernmental treaty that provides a framework for national and international
conservation efforts for the wetlands and their resources.
 It was adopted in Ramsar, a city in Iran in 1971 and came into existence in 1975. Today, it
has total 170 contracting parties.
 India became a party to this convention in 1981.
 India has 46 designated Wetlands under Ramsar Convention. World Wetlands Day is
observed on 2nd February every year.

30. Coral reefs
Coral reefs are some of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. Coral polyps, the animals
primarily responsible for building reefs, can take many forms: large reef building colonies,
graceful flowing fans, and even small, solitary organisms. Thousands of species of corals have
been discovered; some live in warm, shallow, tropical seas and others in the cold, dark depths of
the ocean.
Each individual coral is referred to as a polyp. Coral polyps live on the calcium carbonate
exoskeletons of their ancestors, adding their own exoskeleton to the existing coral structure. As
the centuries pass, the coral reef gradually grows, one tiny exoskeleton at a time, until they
become massive features of the marine environment.
Corals are found all over the world's oceans, from the Aleutian Islands off the coast of Alaska to
the warm tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea. The biggest coral reefs are found in the clear,
shallow waters of the tropics and subtropics. The largest of these coral reef systems, the Great
Barrier Reef in Australia, is more than 1,500 miles long (2,400 kilometers).
Types of coral reefs
Coral reefs take four principal forms.
 Fringing reefs consist of flat reef areas that directly skirt a nonreef island, often volcanic,
or a mainland mass.
 Barrier reefs are also close to a nonreef landmass but lie several kilometres offshore,
separated from the landmass by a lagoon or channel often about 50 metres (160 feet)
deep. Some barrier reefs are more or less circular, surrounding an island, but larger
barrier reefs, such as those along the Red Sea coast and Australia’s Great Barrier Reef,
are complex linear features consisting of chains of reef patches, some of them elongated
into ribbon reefs.
 Atolls are like circular barrier reefs but without their central landmass.
 Finally, there are platform, or patch, reefs, which have irregular table like
or pinnacle features. Smaller patches occur inside atoll lagoons. Larger patches occur as
92
isolated parts of larger developments of any of the other three reef categories. They
sometimes occur completely separate from other kinds of reefs.
Threats to coral reef ecosystems
Unfortunately, coral reef ecosystems are severely threatened. Some threats are natural,
such as diseases, predators, and storms. Other threats are caused by people, including
pollution, sedimentation, unsustainable fishing practices, and climate change, which is
raising ocean temperatures and causing ocean acidification. Many of these threats can
stress corals, leading to coral bleaching and possible death, while others cause physical
damage to these delicate ecosystems. During the 2014-2017 coral bleaching event,
unusually warm waters (partially associated with a strong El Niño) affected 70% of coral
reef ecosystems worldwide. Some areas were hit particularly hard, like the Great Barrier
Reef in Australia, where hundreds of miles of coral were bleached.
Corals are able to recover from bleaching events if conditions improve before they die,
though it can take many years for the ecosystems to fully heal. Scientists are also testing
new ways to help coral reef ecosystems, such as growing coral in a nursery and then
transplanting it to damaged areas.
Coral Reefs in India
 Coral reefs are found in the Gulf of Mannar, Palk Bay and Andaman Sea. Coastal Coral
reefs are found in the Gulf of Kuth and Atolls are found in Lakshadweep. Coral reefs are
listed under Schedule I of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
 Four regions of coral reefs have been recognized for the purpose of management and
conservation in India. These are Gulf Mannar, Andaman and Nicobar Island,
Lakshadweep and Gulf of Kutch.
The year 2008was observed as the world Coral Reef Year. On this occasion, a workshop
was convened by the Lakshadweep Government and National Community Institute of Goa
in Kadmat Island (Lakshadweep).

1. Mineral Resources
A mineral is a natural substance of organic or inorganic origin with definite chemical and
physical properties. India is endowed with a rich variety of mineral resources due to its varied
geological structure. The mineral resources provide the country with the necessary base for
industrial development. The country is particularly rich in metallic minerals of ferrous group.
Indian mining is characterised by a large number of small mines, dominated by the public sector,
which accounts for 75% of the total value of mineral production. Mining policy is pushing the
industry to move toward privately owned, large-scale, mechanised mines. Minor minerals,
mainly sand, gravel, brick, earth and stone, are also important contributors (about 10% of the
value of minerals produced in the country, although data is difficult to come by. Non-metallic
minerals are minor players in the Indian minerals sector in terms of value, though they are big
both in terms of area under mining and volume of minerals produced.
Metallic minerals are the sources of metals. Iron ore, copper, gold produce metal and are
included in this category. Metallic minerals are further divided into ferrous and non-ferrous
metallic minerals. Ferrous, as you know, refers to iron. All those minerals which have iron
content are ferrous such as iron ore itself and those which do not have iron content are non-
ferrous such as copper, bauxite, etc. Non-metallic minerals are either organic in origin such as
fossil fuels also known as mineral fuels which are derived from the buried animal and plant life
such as coal and petroleum. Other type of non-metallic minerals are inorganic in origin such as
mica, limestone and graphite, etc. Some new petroleum reserves are also found in the Krishna-
Godavari and Kaveri basins (shown in the image given above).
Distribution of Minerals
 Minerals are unevenly distributed on the earth’s surface.
 All minerals are exhaustible in nature, i.e., will exhaust after a certain time.
 However, these minerals take long time to form, but they cannot be replenished
immediately at the time of need.
 More than 97% of coal reserves occur in the valleys of Damodar, Sone, Mahanadi, and
Godavari rivers.
8
 Petroleum reserves in India are located in the sedimentary basins of Assam, Gujarat, and
Mumbai High (i.e. off-shore region in the Arabian Sea – shown in the map given below).
Mineral Belts in India
 Further, there are three major mineral belts in India namely −
o The North-Eastern Plateau Region,
o The South-Western Plateau Region, and
o The North-Western Region.
North-Eastern Plateau Region
 The major areas of north-eastern plateau region are Chhotanagpur (Jharkhand), Odisha,
West Bengal, and parts of Chhattisgarh.
 Iron ore, coal, manganese, bauxite, and mica are the major minerals of the north-eastern
plateau region.
South-Western Plateau Region
 The south-western plateau region covers major parts of Karnataka, Goa, and contiguous
Tamil Nadu uplands and Kerala.
 Major mineral resources of south-western plateau region are iron ore, manganese, and
limestone.
 Kerala has deposits of monazite and thorium, and bauxite clay and Goa has deposits of
iron ore.
North-Western Region
 The north-western region covers the areas of Aravalli in Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat.
 Major minerals of north-western regions are copper and zinc; other significant minerals
include sandstone, granite, and marble, along with Gypsum and Fuller’s earth deposits.
 In addition, Gujarat and Rajasthan, both have rich sources of salt.
 The Himalayan belt is also an important mineral belt, as it has rich deposits of copper,
lead, zinc, cobalt, and tungsten.

3. Energy Resources
Energy resources are required for all activities. Mineral fuels are essential for generation of
power, required by agriculture, industry, transport and other sectors of the economy. It is needed
to cook, to provide light and heat, to propel vehicles and to drive machinery in industries.
Mineral fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas (known as fossil fuels), nuclear energy
minerals, are the conventional sources of energy. These conventional sources are exhaustible
resources
Energy exists in several forms such as heat, kinetic or mechanical energy, light, potential energy,
electrical, or other forms. Energy is the ability to do work. Energy sources could be classified as
Renewable and Non-renewable.
Energy is one of the major inputs for the economic development of any country. In the case of
the developing countries, the energy sector assumes a critical importance in view of the ever
increasing energy needs requiring huge investments to meet them. Energy can be classified into
several types based on the following criteria:
• Primary and Secondary energy
• Commercial and Non commercial energy
• Renewable and Non-Renewable energy
Primary and Secondary Energy:
Primary energy sources are those that are either found or stored in nature. Common primary
energy sources are coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass (such as wood). Other primary energy
sources available include nuclear energy from radioactive substances, thermal energy stored in
earth's interior, and potential energy due to earth's gravity. The major primary and secondary
energy sources are shown in Figure 1.1 Primary energy sources are mostly converted in
industrial utilities into secondary energy sources; for example coal, oil or gas converted into
steam and electricity. Primary energy can also be used directly. Some energy sources have non-
energy uses, for example coal or natural gas can be used as a feedstock in fertiliser plants.
17
Commercial Energy and Non Commercial Energy:
Commercial Energy
The energy sources that are available in the market for a definite price are known as commercial
energy. By far the most important forms of commercial energy are electricity, coal and refined
petroleum products. Commercial energy forms the basis of industrial, agricultural, transport and
commercial development in the modern world. In the industrialized countries, commercialized
fuels are predominant source not only for economic production, but also for many household
tasks of general population. Examples: Electricity, lignite, coal, oil, natural gas etc.
Non-Commercial Energy
The energy sources that are not available in the commercial market for a price are classified as
non-commercial energy. Non-commercial energy sources include fuels such as firewood, cattle
dung and agricultural wastes, which are traditionally gathered, and not bought at a price used
especially in rural households. These are also called traditional fuels. Non-commercial energy is
often ignored in energy
accounting. Example: Firewood,
agro waste in rural areas; solar
energy for water heating,
electricity generation, for drying
grain, fish and fruits; animal
power for transport, threshing,
lifting water for irrigation,
crushing sugarcane; wind energy
for lifting water and electricity
generation.
Renewable and Non-
Renewable Energy
Renewable energy is energy
obtained from sources that are
essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable resources include wind power, solar power,
18
geothermal energy, tidal power and hydroelectric power (See Figure 1.2). The most important
feature of renewable energy is that it can be harnessed without the release of harmful pollutants.
Non-renewable energy is the conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely
to deplete with time.

4. Coal Production in India
 Coal is a one of the important minerals which is mainly used in the generation of thermal
power and smelting of iron ore. Coal occurs in rock sequences mainly of two geological
ages, namely Gondwana and tertiary deposits.
 India has 4th largest reserves of coal and holds about 315 billion tons of word’s proven
reserves. India is the third largest coal producer in the world after China and USA.
 One the basis of proportion of carbon content, various types of coal are Anthracite (80-
95%), Bituminous (55-65%), Lignite (45-55%) and Peat (35-5%).

 The most important Gondwana coal fields of India are located in Damodar Valley
region.
 About 80 per cent of the coal deposits in India is of bituminous type and is of non-coking
grade. The most important Gondwana coal fields of India are located in Damodar Valley.
They lie in Jharkhand-Bengal coal belt and the important coal fields in this region are
Raniganj, Jharia, Bokaro, Giridih, Karanpura.
 Raniganj, Jharia, Bokaro, Giridih, and Karanpura are major coalfields of Jharkhand-
Bengal coal belt.

Coal Production
 Through sustained programme of investment and greater thrust on application of modern
technologies, it has been possible to raise the All India production of coal at 730.354
million tonnes in 2018-19 (Provisional) with a positive growth of 7.9%.
 Coal India Limited has set up Regional Sales Offices and Sub-Sales Offices at selected
places in the country to cater to the needs of the consuming sectors in various regions.
 As per the present import policy, coal can be freely imported (under Open General
Licence) by the consumers themselves considering their needs based on their commercial
prudence.
 Coking Coal is being imported by Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and other Steel
manufacturing units mainly to bridge the gap between the requirement and indigenous
availability and to improve the quality of production.
 Coal based power plants, cement plants, captive power plants, sponge iron plants,
industrial consumers and coal traders are importing non-coking coal.
 Coke is imported mainly by pig-Iron manufacturers and Iron & Steel sector consumers
using mini-blast furnace.
 Details of import of coal and products i.e. coke during the last six years is as under:
21
Coal Reserves
 As a result of exploration carried out up to the maximum depth of 1200 m, a cumulative
total of 319.02 Billion tonnes of Geological Resources of Coal have so far been estimated
in the country till April, 2018.
 Hard coal deposit spread over 27 major coalfields, are mainly confined to eastern and
south central parts of the country. The lignite reserves stand at a level around 36 billion
tonnes, of which 90% occur in the southern State of Tamil Nadu.
 Top 5 States in terms of total coal reserves in India are: Jharkhand > Odisha >
Chhattisgarh > West Bengal > Madhya Pradesh.
Classification of Coal
 Coal is originated from organic matter wood. When large tracts of forests are buried
under sediments, wood is burnt and decomposed due to heat from below and pressure
from above. The phenomenon makes coal but takes centuries to complete.
 Classification of Coal can be done on the basis of carbon content and time period.

22
 On the basis of carbon content it can be classified into following three types:
o Anthracite: It is the best quality of coal with highest calorific value and
carries 80 to 95% carbon content. It ignites slowly with a blue flame and found
in small quantities in Jammu and Kashmir.
o Bituminous: It has a low level of moisture content with 60 to 80% of carbon
content and has a high calorific value. Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha,
Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh have deposits of Bituminous.
o Lignite carries 40 to 55% carbon content and is often brown in colour with high
moisture content thus, gives smoke when burnt. Rajasthan, Lakhimpur
(Assam) and Tamil Nadu has deposits of Lignite.
o Peat is the first stage of transformation from wood to coal with low calorific
value and less than 40% carbon content.

5. Petroleum Production in India
The word Petroleum has a Latin origin (Petra „„rock” + Oleum “oil”). Petroleum is also known
as Black Gold. It is oil obtained from rocks; particularly sedimentary rocks of the earth.
Therefore, it is also called mineral oil. Petroleum is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons
(90 to 95 per cent Hydrocarbons) of varying specific gravity, ranging from thick viscous liquids
and dissolved waxy solids through lighter oils to gaseous compounds (5-10 % organic
compounds containing oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and traces of organometallic compounds). The
quality of petroleum depends chiefly on the relative proportions of the different hydrocarbons
and the amount of impurities like sulphur. Light oils have low percentage of carbon and high
percentage of hydrocarbon. Petroleum varies in color from light straw to almost black, some
kinds are greenish, amber (yellowish brown) colored and even rich wine red.
Origin and Occurrence of Petroleum:
Petroleum has an organic origin and is found in sedimentary basins, shallow depressions and in
the seas. Oil and natural gas originates from animal or vegetable matter contained in shallow
marine sediments. Conditions for oil formation were favorable in lower and middle tertiary
period (dense forest and sea organism), found in pore spaces of rocks where structure gave rise
to traps in which the minute droplets accumulated and were prevented from escaping by
impervious cap rock. Anticlines are the best known structures favorable for petroleum
accumulation. Normally, oil is associated with water, being lighter than water (specific gravity
0.8-0.98) it collects in the anticlines above the surface of water. Gas is still lighter and occurs
above oil.
Distribution of Petroleum and Mineral Oil in India
 Process began in tertiary period, about 3 million years ago.
 Most of the oil reserves in India are associated with anticlines and fault traps in the
sedimentary rock formations of tertiary times.
 In tertiary period, aquatic life was abundant in various forms, especially the minor
microscopic forms of flora and fauna.
24
Extent of Oil bearing Strata in India

6. Generation of Thermal Power in India
In India, power is generated from conventional (Thermal, Nuclear & Hydro) and renewable
sources (Wind, Solar, Biomass etc.). However, Major production of Electricity is achieved
through coal a thermal power plant which is around 75% of the total power generation. India’s
total power generation in Dec 2020 stood at 103.66 billion units, according to data realised by
the Central Electricity Authority.
Types of Thermal Power Plants
As the name suggests, thermal power plants generate electricity by using heat from a fuel source.
The heat usually generates steam in a boiler which is then used to run a steam turbine connected
to a generator. They are classified according to the heat source as follows:
 Coal-Fired
 Gas
 Diesel or Liquid fuel

7. Nuclear Power in India
Nuclear energy has emerged as a viable source in recent times. Important minerals used for the
generation of nuclear energy are uranium and thorium. Uranium deposits occur in the Dharwar
rocks. Geographically, uranium ores are known to occur in several locations along the Singbhum
Copper belt. It is also found in Udaipur, Alwar and Jhunjhunu districts of Rajasthan, Durg
district of Chhattisgarh, Bhandara district of Maharashtra and Kullu district of Himachal
Pradesh. Thorium is mainly obtained from monazite and ilmenite in the beach sands along the
coast of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. World’s richest monazite deposits occur in Palakkad and
Kollam districts of Kerala, near Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Mahanadi river delta in
Odisha.
 Nuclear energy has emerged as a viable source of clean energy in recent times. In a process
called nuclear fission, the nucleus of a heavy atom (such as Uranium, Thorium or Plutonium),
when bombarded with low energy neutrons, can be split apart into lighter nuclei and as a
result tremendous amount of energy is released.
 The Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1948 by the efforts of Dr. Homi Jehangir
Bhabha, the father of Atomic Energy Research in India.
 The atomic energy Department was established in 1954. It is the apex body regarding of
nuclear energy.
 India’s First Atomic Research Reactor, Apsara was established at Trombay near Mumbai.
India’s first Nuclear Power Reactor was established at Tarapur in 1969.
 The production of nuclear energy requires Uranium, Thorium and Heavy Water. Uranium is
found in Jharkhand, Rajasthanand Meghalaya.
 The atomic Energy department has decided to achieve the target of electricity production of
20 Gigawatt by 2020.
 As of March 2018, India has 22 nuclear reactors in operation in 7 nuclear power plants, with
total installed capacity of 6,780 MW.

9. Renewable Energy (RE) Resources
As we know that Fossil fuel sources, such as coal, petroleum, natural gas and nuclear energy use
exhaustible raw materials. Renewable energy is energy obtained from sources that are essentially
inexhaustible. Therefore, renewable energy sources are only the Sustainable energy resources in
the world the like solar, wind, hydrogeothermal and biomass. These energy sources are more
equitably distributed and environment-friendly. The non-conventional energy sources will
provide more sustained, eco-friendly cheaper energy after the initial cost is taken care of.
Renewable Energy (RE) Capacity of India:
 The country’s installed Renewable Energy (RE) capacity stands at 150.54 GW (solar:
48.55 GW, wind: 40.03 GW, Small hydro Power: 4.83, Bio-power: 10.62, Large Hydro:
46.51 GW) as on 30th Nov. 2021 while its nuclear energy based installed electricity
capacity stands at 6.78 GW.
 India has the 4th largest wind power capacity in the world.
 This brings the total non-fossil based installed energy capacity to 157.32 GW which is
40.1% of the total installed electricity capacity of 392.01 GW.
 At the COP26 India is committed to achieving 500 GW of installed electricity capacity
from non-fossil fuel sources by the year 2030.

10. Agriculture
Agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy. Over 70 per cent of the rural households
depend on agriculture. Agriculture is an important sector of Indian economy as it contributes
about 17% to the total GDP and provides employment to around 58% of the population.
Over the past few decades, the manufacturing and services sectors have increasingly contributed
to the growth of the economy, while the agriculture sector’s contribution has decreased from
more than 50% of GDP in the 1950s to 15.4% in 2015-16 (at constant prices).
Sustainable agriculture, in terms of food security rural employment, environmentally sustainable
technologies such as soil conservation, sustainable nature resource management and biodiversity
protection are essential for holistic rural development. On the recommendations of National
Commission on Farmers, agriculture has been shifted to State list from Union list.
India has been divided into 15 Agro Climate Zones on the basis of geographical features and
agricultural practices.
Salient features of Indian Agriculture
 Subsistence agriculture: The type of agriculture in India is mostly Subsistence
agriculture. In Subsistence agriculture the agricultural produce is for self-consumption
only, there is no surplus production to sell in the market.
 Commercial agriculture: Large-scale commercial agriculture is also practiced in India,
such as tea plantation in Assam, coffee in Karnataka, coconut in Kerala, etc. Commercial
Agriculture is the agricultural practice where large agricultural produce is sold in the
market by the firms for making profits.
 Since the land resource in India is limited the pressure of increasing population on
agriculture is increasing day by day.
 Mechanization: After Green Revolution, there has been an increasing trend in the use of
machines in farm operations. This has led to the mechanization of Indian agriculture.
Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, River valleys of Andhra, and Tamil Nadu are
major agriculturally mechanized areas in India.
41
 Monsoon dependent: Due to lack of irrigation facilities Two-third of Indian agriculture
is dependent on monsoon rains.
 Variety of crops: Due to the presence of different types of topography, diverse soil (like
alluvial, red, black cotton soil, etc), and different types of climate, India is blessed with
the production of different varieties of crops in different regions. For eg., hilly areas are
suitable for tea cultivation, plains for rice cultivation
 Predominance of food crops: In order to feed a large population and predominance of
subsistence agriculture, food crops are mainly grown in order to keep with the food
security demands of the huge Indian population.
 Arable Land – Both net sown area and fallow lands are included under this category.
 Fallow Land - It is that type of land in which no crop has been grown for one to five
years.
 Barren Land – The type of land which is not suitable for cultivation. Sometimes, an
arable land becomes barren because of unscientific cultivation.

Uttar Pradesh has the largest number of landholder.
 Agriculture Census is held in every 5 year, the first being conducted in 1970-71.
There are three distinct crop seasons in the northern and interior parts of the country, namely
Kharif, rabi, and Zaid.
 The Kharif season: The crops which are grown in the Kharif season require a good
amount of water, thus the sowing of Kharif crops largely coincides with the onset of the
Southwest Monsoon.
 The Rabi season: The sowing of rabi crops begins with the onset of winter in October-
November and the harvesting is done in March-April. The celebration of the festival Holi
can be related to a good harvest in the month of March- April.
 The Zaid season: It is a short duration summer cropping season beginning after
harvesting of rabi crops, the cultivation of watermelons, cucumbers, vegetables, and
fodder crops during this season is done on irrigated lands.
Classification of Crops
Type Months Crops
1. Rabi Crops Oct-Nov to Mar-Apr Wheat, Barley, Gram, Peas, Mustard, Potato etc.
2. Kharif Crops June-July to Oct-Nov Rice, Jowar, Bajra, Maize, Groundnut, Cotton, Ragi,

11. Agro Climate Zones in India
The Agricultural regions in India are fully controlled by a set of inter-related geographic factors.
They are: a) Climatic factors b) Soil properties and c) Physiographic settings ( topography &
drainage). This identification of agro-climatic zones for the purpose of developing location
specific research and development strategies for increasing agricultural production has been
given the due impetus recently. In order to plan agricultural activities more accurately each
region into sub regions based on soil, climate (temperature), rainfall and other agro
meteorological characteristics.
Planning Commission has demarcated the geographical area of India into 15 agro-climatic
regions. These are further divided into more homogeneous 72 sub-zones.
The main objectives of agro-climatic regions are:
(i) to optimise agricultural production;
(ii) to increase farm income;
(iii) to generate more rural employment;
(iv) to make a judicious use of the available irrigation water;
(v) to reduce the regional inequalities in the development of agriculture.

46
Zone 1- Western Himalayan Region:
It includes Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Kumaun-Garhwal areas of
Uttaranchal. It shows great variation in relief. Summer season is mild (July average
temperature 5°C-30°C) but the winter season experiences severe cold conditions (January
temperature 0°C to -4°C). The amount of average annual rainfall is 150 cms. Zonal
arrangement in vegetation is found with varying height along the hill slopes. Valleys and
duns have thick layers of alluvium while hill slopes have thin brown hilly soils. The region is
gifted with a number of perennial streams due to high rainfall and snowcovered mountain
peaks of which Ganga, Yamuna, Jhelum, Chenab, Satluj and Beas etc. are worthy of mention.
These provide irrigation water to canals and cheap hydel power for agriculture and industries.
In recent years the increasing human interference has led to the deterioration of the ecological
system. Rapid construction activities in the form of buildings and transport routes and
unscrupulous mining have led to the depletion of vegetal cover making the area prone to
landslides, pollution, receding glaciers and water scarcity. Rice is the main crop of this region
which is cultivated in terraced fields along the hill slopes. Maize, wheat, potato, barley are
other important crops. Temperate fruits like apple and pear etc. are produced in some parts of
Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Similarly tea plantations have started in some
areas of Garhwal-Kumaun hills. The horticulture of the region is obsessed with the problems
of financial crisis, long gestation period, lack of improved varieties of plants and high post-
harvest losses (about 20% in packing, storage, marketing and processing). This needs
improvement in old unproductive orchards using the recent technique of grafting,
introduction of new fast growing varieties of plants and development of infrastructural
facilities. Environmental conditions of this region are well suited for the development of
garden and plantation crops. A more rational land use planning is required for the region.
Land suitable for agriculture, horticulture, pasture, forestry respectively should be
demarcated on the following basis: (a) agriculture on land of up to 30 per cent slopes; (b)
land having 30-50 per cent slopes for horticulture/fodder development; and (c) all lands
above 50 per cent slopes under tree cover. Better quality planting material should be made
available to fruit growers. The region has favourable climatic conditions for growing
temperate vegetables, flowers, and crops like ginger and saffron.
Zone 2 - Eastern Himalayan Region:
The Eastern Himalayan region consists of Sikkim, Darjeeling area (West Bengal), Arunachal
Pradesh, Assam hills, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura. It is
47
characterised by rugged topography, thick forest cover and sub-humid climate (rainfall over
200 cm; temperature July 25°C-33°C, January 11°C-24°C). The soil is brownish, thick
layered and less fertile. Shifting cultivation (Jhum) is practised in nearly 1/ 3 of the cultivated
area and food crops are raised mainly for sustenance. Rice, potato, maize, tea and fruits
(orange, pine-apple, lime, lichi etc.) are the main crops. The ecological system of the region
is problematic. The region needs marked improvement in infrastructural facilities to
accelerate the pace of development. Soil degradation should be arrested by controlling
deforestation and by terracing in hills. The run-off should be checked and water conserved
should be utilised in minor irrigation. Shifting cultivation should be controlled by
encouraging permanent settlement. A programme to grow fruits above 30% slopes in the hills
needs to be framed. Supporting activities of sericulture, handicrafts poultry, and piggery etc.
should be promoted. A long term quality seed production plan should be implemented to
assure adequate supply of quality seeds to the farmers
Zone 3 - Lower Gangetic Plains Region:
This region spreads over eastern Bihar, West Bengal and Assam valley. Here average
amount of annual rainfall lies between 100 cm-200 cm. Temperature for July month varies
from 26°C-41°C and for January month 9°C-24 0C. The region has adequate storage of
ground water with high water table. Wells and canals are the main source of irrigation. The
problem of water logging and marshy lands is acute in some parts of the region. Rice is the
main crop which at times yields three successive crops (Aman, Aus and Boro) in a year. Jute,
maize, potato, and pulses are other important crops. Planning strategies include improvement
in rice farming, horticulture (banana, mango and citrus fruits), pisciculture, poultry, livestock,
forage production and seed supply. An export processing zone for marine and sea foods
needs to be established which should be equipped with modern facilities of freezing, canning,
dehydration, and quality control. Organisational set-up for implementation should include: (a)
a committee at the State level to guide and monitor implementation; (b) the Zila Parishads at
the district level; and (c) a village level committee under the aegis of the Panchayat backed
by trained staff (Wadia, 1996, p. 96).
Zone 4 - Middle Gangetic Plains Region:
It incorporates eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (except Chotanagpur plateau). It is a fertile
alluvial plain drained by Ganga River and its tributaries. The average temperature of July
month varies from 26°C- 4I°C and that of January month 9°C-24°C.The amount of annual
rainfall lies between 100 cm and 200 cm. The region has vast potential of ground water and
48
surface runoff in the form of perennial rivers which is utilised for irrigation through tube
wells, canals and wells. Rice, maize, millets in, kharif, wheat, gram, barley, peas, mustard
and potato in rabi are important crops. The agricultural strategy included introduction of
modern market oriented agriculture in place of the traditional one. Efforts should be made to
improve and stabilise yield of kharif paddy which accounts for over 40 per cent of gross
cropped area in the region. Similarly increasing maize production, replacing upland paddy
and millets with fruits, vegetables and kharif pulses (Arahar), encouraging pre-kharif paddy
(January to June) or maize in low lands, improving low land cultivation through water
harvesting structures and alternative farming systems, and utilising chaur lands for
pisciculture are some other suggested measures to boost up agricultural production. The
strategy also includes reclamation of 5.5 lakh ha of usar lands, 25.4 lakh ha of wastelands,
and 16.5 lakh ha of fallow lands for agriculture and allied activities (agroforestry, silviculture,
floriculture etc.). Supplementary measures should include input delivery system,
demonstration of recommended package of practices, particularly for kharif paddy,
diversification of crops like vegetables and fruits, and provisions of processing and marketing
facilities, poultry, dairying and inland riverine fishery.
Zone 5 - Upper Gangetic Plains Region:
This region encompasses central and western parts of Uttar Pradesh. The climate is
subhumid continental with July month's temperature between 26°-41°C, January month's
temperature between 7°- 23°C and average annual rainfall between 75 cm- 150 cm. The soil
is sandy loam. It has 131 per cent irrigation intensity and 144 per cent cropping intensity.
Canal, tube well and wells are the main source of irrigation. This is an intensive agricultural
region where in wheat, rice, sugarcane, millets, maize, gram, barley, oilseeds, pulses and
cotton are the main crops. Besides modernising traditional agriculture the region needs
special focus on dairy development and horticulture. Strategies should include developing
multiple mixed cropping patterns like rice-potato- wheat-moong and sugarcane , sunflower,
and potato + mustard; improving irrigation system and water management such as lining of
canals to check seepage; reclaiming saline/alkaline soils; raising fruit trees on Diara areas;
devoting uplands to horticulture; improving cattle breed and bringing more areas to fodder
crops.
Zone 6 - Trans-Gangetic Plains Region:
The Trans Ganga Plain consists of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Chandigarh and Ganganagar
district of Rajasthan. The climate has semiarid characteristics with July month's temperature
49
between 26°C and 42°C, January temperature ranging from 7°C to 22°C and average annual
rainfall between 70 cm and 125 cm. Private tube wells and canals provide principal means of
irrigation. Important crops include wheat, sugarcane, cotton, rice, gram, maize, millets, pulses
and oilseeds etc. The region has the credit of introducing Green Revolution in the country and
has adopted modern methods of farming with greater degree of mechanisation. The region is
also facing the menacing problem of water logging, salinity, alkalinity, soil erosion and
falling water table. The suggested strategies include: (a) diversion of 5 per cent of rice-wheat
area to other crops like maize, pulses, oilseeds and fodder, (b) development of genotypes of
rice, maize and wheat with inbuilt resistance to pests and diseases, (c) promotion of
horticulture besides pulses like tur and peas in upland conditions, (d) cultivation of vegetables
in the vicinity of industrial clusters, (e) supply of quality seeds of vegetables and planting
material for horticulture crops, (f) development of infrastructure of transit godowns and
processing to handle additional fruit and vegetable production, (g) implementation of policy
and programmes to increase productivity of milk and wool, and (h) development of high
quality fodder crops and animal feed by stepping up area under fodder production by 10
percent (Wadia 1996, p. 100).
Zone 7 - Eastern Plateau and Hills Region:
It comprises the Chotanagpur plateau Rajmahal hills, Chhattisgarh plains and Dandakaranya.
The region enjoys 26°C-34°C of temperature in July, 10°C-27° C in January and 80 cm-150
cm of annual rainfall. Soils are red and yellow with occasional patches of laterites and
alluviums. The region is deficient in water resources due to plateau structure and non-
perennial streams. Rainfed agriculture is practised growing crops like rice, millets, maize,
oilseeds, ragi, gram and potato. The region requires planning to maximise use of rainwater,
increase in ground water potential, change cropping pattern to achieve a balanced crop
production and strengthen input and services delivery systems, Suggested strategies include:
(a) coverage of large areas with quality seeds of HYV, (b) cultivation of high value crops of
pulses like tur, groundnut and soyabean etc. on upland rained areas, (c) growing crops like
urad, castor, and groundnut in kharif and mustard and vegetables in irrigated areas, (d)
improvement of indigenous breeds of cattle and buffaloes, (e) rehabilitation of 30 per cent of
degraded forest lands, (f) extension of fruit plantations, (g) renovation including desalting of
existing tanks and excavation of new tanks, (h) reclamation of 95.32 lakh ha of acidic lands
through lime treatment, (i) development of inland fisheries in permanent water bodies, and (j)
adopting integrated watershed development approach to conserve soil and rain water.

rainfall from 50 cm- 100 cm. Soils are mixed red, yellow and black growing crops like
millets, gram, barley, wheat, cotton, sunflower, etc. The region has dearth of water resources.
The suggested measures should include water conservation through water saving devices like
sprinklers and drip system; dry farming popularisation; dairy development, crop
diversification, ground water development, diversion of 16 lakh ha of low value crops to high
value crops, reclamation of ravine lands and improvement in indigenous breed cattle.
Zone 9 - Western Plateau and Hills Region:

region of the regard soil with July temperature between 24°C-41 °C, January temperature
between 6°C- 23°C and average annual rainfall of 25 cm-75 cm. Net sown areas is 65 per
cent and forests occupy only 11 per cent. Only 12.4 per cent area is irrigated. Jowar, cotton,
sugarcane, rice, bajra, wheat, gram, pulses, potato, groundnut and oilseeds are the principal
crops. The area is known for its oranges, grapes and bananas. Since the region is deficient in
water resources attention be paid to increasing water efficiency by popularizing water saving
devices like sprinklers and drip system. The lower value crops of jowar, bajra and rainfed
wheat should give way to high value oilseeds like sunflower, safflower and mustard. Five per
cent area under rainfed cotton and jowar could be substituted with fruits like ber,
pomegranate, mango and guava, appropriate marketing, storage and processing infrastructure
to handle added fruit production should be developed. Improvement of milk production of
cattle and buffalo through cross-breeding along with poultry development should be taken
care of.
Zone 10 - Southern Plateau and Hills Region:

cropping intensity of 111 per cent. Low value cereals and minor millets predominate. Coffee,
tea, cardamom and spices are grown along the hilly slopes of Karnataka plateau. Suggested
strategies include: (a) diversion of 20 per cent of area under jowar/bajra/ragi to
51
groundnut/sesamum/sunflower, (b) cultivation of soyabean/ safflower on residual moisture
after rice, (c) development of horticulture, (d) restoration of tank irrigation by taking
appropriate measures of deepening, embanking etc., (e) use of water saving devices like
sprinklers and drip system, (f) development of location specific dry land farming technology,
viz. early fertilizer responsive varieties of jowar and rice, and (g) implementation of
programmes for poultry farming and dairy development.

the menacing problem of alkalinity. The region accounts for 20.33 per cent of rice and 17.05
per cent of groundnut production of the country. Main crops include rice, jute, tobacco,
sugarcane, maize, millets, groundnut and oilseeds. Main agricultural strategies include
improvement in the cultivation of spices (pepper and cardamom) and development of
fisheries. These involve increasing cropping intensity using water-efficient crops on residual
moisture, discouraging growing of rice on marginal lands and bring such lands under
alternate crops like oilseeds and pulses; diversifying cropping and avoiding mono-cropping;
developing horticulture in upland areas; increasing marine, brackish water and inland
fisheries; upgrading genetic potential of existing animals; improving tank irrigation by
desalting and embanking existing tanks and improving field channels and structures; and

for plantation crops and spices which are raised along the hill slopes of the Ghats. The
strategies include development of high value crops and fisheries, protection of land from
salinity ingress and provision of drainage improvement. A programme to sink about 5 lakh
dug wells and shallow wells should be undertaken on priority basis. The approach of
homestead system of reclaiming and using Khar lands be accepted, planned and
implemented. Low productivity areas of paddy and millets under rained conditions should be
diverted to horticultural crops like mango, banana, coconut etc. to cover about 0.5 lakh ha.
52
Appropriate infrastructure for fruit marketing and processing should be developed. Increasing
mechanised fishing boats for deep sea fishing, strengthening of cold storage, processing, and
transport infrastructure in corporate/cooperative sector, and providing incentives for prawn
culture in brackish water should be taken up.

features. Land-man ratio is high. Forest area is only 1.2 per cent. Land under pastures is also
low (4.3 per cent). Cultivable waste and fallow lands account for nearly 42 per cent of the
geographical area. Net irrigated area is only 6.3 per cent of net sown area which is 44.4 per
cent of the geographical area. Bajra, jowar, and moth are main crops of kharif and wheat and
gram in rabi. Livestock contributes greatly in desert ecology. Agricultural development
strategies include completion of on-going irrigation projects; making research on the use of
saline water; popularising bajra varieties giving higher biomass; promoting use of fertilisers;
making improved seeds available to farmers, constructing moisture (rain water) conservation
structures; increasing yield level of fruits like date palm, water-melon and guava; adopting
high quality germ-plasm in cattle to improve their breed; and adopting silvi-pastoral system
over wastelands through aerial and manual seeding.
53
Zone 15 - The Islands Region:

equatorial climate (annual rainfall less than 300 cm the mean July and January temperature of
Port Blair being 30°C and 25°C respectively). The soils vary from sandy along the cost to
clayey loam in valleys and lower slopes. The main crops are rice, maize, millets, pulses, areca
nut, turmeric and cassava. Nearly half of the area is under coconut. The area is covered with
thick forests and agriculture is a backward stage. The main thrust in development should be
on crop improvement, water management and fisheries. Improved verity of rice3 seeds
should be popularised so as to enable farmers to take two crops of rice in place of one. For
fisheries development multi-purpose fishing vessels for deep sea fishing should be
introduced, suitable infrastructure for storage and processing of fish should be built up, and
brackish water prawn culture should be promoted in the coastal area.

14. Major Revolutions in Agriculture
Agricultural revolution can be referred to the significant changes in agriculture when certain
inventions, discoveries or new technologies implemented time to time in India. These
revolutions change the ways of production and increase the production rate.
There have been many agricultural revolutions in India to focus on certain specific
agricultural produce. These agricultural revolutions helped Indian agriculture grow
exponentially and created new opportunities.
Major Revolutions in Agriculture
Revolution Production
 Black Revolution Petroleum Production
 Blue Revolution Fish Production
 Brown Revolution Leather/Cocoa production
 Golden Fibre Revolution Jute Production
 Golden Revolution Overall Horticulture development/Honey Production
 Pink Revolution Onion Production/Pharmaceutical/Prawn Production
 Grey Revolution Fertilizer Revolution
 Red Revolution Meat and Tomato Production
 Round Revolution Potato Production
 Silver Fibre Revolution Cotton Production
 Silver Revolution Egg and Polutry Production
 White Revolution Milk and Dairy Production
 Yellow Revolution Oil Seeds Production
 Green Gold Revoltuion Bamboo
Green Revolution
 The Green Revolution refers to measures introduced worldwide from the 1950s
onward. These had the goal of increasing harvests and ending large-scale hunger.
Green Revolution owes its origin in the finding of new dwarf variety of wheat seed by
Dr. Norman Earnest Borlaug.
 The initial years of the post-independence period saw the Indian agricultural system at
its worst. Lack of funds, low yielding raw material, a dearth of machinery and
technology; were some of the main problems at that time.
73
 Understanding the deteriorating condition of the agriculture sector, the Indian
Government launched the Green Revolution through which the use of High Yielding
Variety (HYV) seeds was adopted in the country. Along with this, took place the up-
gradation in irrigation facilities as well as the use of more effective fertilizers. All this
together led to the mass production of high-quality crops in India. To find an optimum
solution for these issues, in the year 1965 under the guidance of M.S. Swaminathan,
the Indian government launched the Green Revolution that lasted from 1967- 1978.
 The states which benefitted from green revolution include Punjab, Haryana and
western Uttar Pradesh and Ganganagar district of Rajasthan.
Features of Green Revolution
Given below are the features of the Green Revolution:
 The most effective feature of all was the introduction of HYV seeds in Indian
agriculture. The seeds proved out to be highly effective in the regions with fluent
irrigation facilities, thus, the first stage was focused on Punjab and Tamil Nadu.
 In the second stage of the scheme, other states were included too and seeds for various
crops other than wheat were used.
 This Revolution initiated the use of an inland irrigation system as the country cannot
depend only on monsoon for their water needs.
 The plan majorly focused on the production of food grains like wheat, rice, etc and
commercial crops like jute, cotton, oilseeds etc. were prohibited from the plan.
 It promoted the use of fertilizers and manures whereas limiting the use of pesticides
and weedicides in order to avoid any sort of crop damage
 The use of technologically advanced machinery like tractors, drills, harvesters, etc
was implemented
Impact of Green Revolution in India
Green Revolution in India has impacted and benefitted millions of people in the country
through the following points:
 Enhancing the Agricultural Production: There was a great boom in the production of
grains especially wheat as it increased from 11 million tonnes in 1960 to 55 million
tonnes in 1990.
74
 Increase in per Acre Yield: The major impact of this Revolution can be seen whilst
measuring the per acre production of crops that recorded a jaw-dropping spike of 850
kg/hectare to 2281 kg/hectare.
 Independency in Terms of Import: With the hike in production, adequate stocks were
assembled for emergencies. This led to exemption of import and India began
exporting.
 Employment: As the scheme involved transportation, irrigation, food processing,
marketing and various other opportunities; Green Revolution helped people combat
unemployment.
 Relief to the Farmers: The miserable conditions of farmers due to depletion of the
agricultural sector was no longer the same. Farmers not only experienced a hike in
their income but also started earning luxuries.
Drawbacks of Green Revolution
Even after being recognized as one of the most significant developments in the agricultural
sector across the globe, Green Revolution too had some drawbacks. Mentioned below are the
drawbacks of this Revolution in India.
 The major imbalance was seen amongst the food grains. Auto greens like wheat, rice,
bajra, jowar and maize would be a part of the plan but it mainly empowered wheat.
 HYV seeds for crops like pulses, oilseeds, cereals, etc are not developed yet or they
are not highly efficient.
 Regional disparities begin to ignite with the widespread Green Revolution. As it only
benefited areas like Punjab, Haryana, Western UP, Tamil Nadu; the entire Eastern
region- West Bengal, Orissa, Assam, etc are completely untouched.
 This revolution also has a severe impact on the soil as repetitive production of the
same crop on the same soil results in soil depletion.
Protein Revolution
 Related Higher Production also Known as Technology driven 2nd Green revolution
coined by P.M Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jetley.
75
 A price Stabilization fund of Rs. 500 crore to help farmers deal with volatality also a
TV Channerl has been set up to provide Information to the Farmers about Water
Conservation, Organic Farming and other New Techniques
Ever Green Revolution
 Mainly COncentrates on Overall Production of Agriculture, Started in 11th 5 year
Plan.
 M.S Swaminathan has Renowed as Father of Ever Green Revolution in India
emphasized to Improve Productivity perpetuity with out harming ecologically or
Socially.
Green Revolution
 In this Period Advanced technologies has been Implemeneted and Productivity in
Agriculture has Been Increased Globally.Father of Green revolution is Dr. Norman
Borlaug
 The Main Purpose of this Revolution was to save a billion people from starvation
White Revolution
 Concentrates mainly on Milk and Dairy Products, Verghese Kurien Known as Milk
Man of India.
 White Revolution is the Success Story of Dairy Co-Operative Movemnet in the
country
 Operation Flood Program launched by government of India with international
cooperation.
Yellow Revolution
 Oilseed Production (Especially Mustard and Sunflower), Sam Pitroda father of
Yellow Revolution.
 The main contributors to this factor are- the oil seeds production technology, price
and market intervention support policy, expansion in area under oilseed, and the
institutional support.
Brown Revolution
 Leather / Cocoa / Non-Conventional Products.
76
 It’s happened in the tribal Areas of Vishakapatnam

upon livestock for their livelihood. Livestock contributed 16% to the income of small farm
households as against an average of 14% for all rural households. Livestock provides
livelihood to two-third of rural community. It also provides employment to about 8.8 % of
the population in India. India has vast livestock resources. Livestock sector contributes 4.11%
GDP and 25.6% of total Agriculture GDP.

rate of 7.9 per cent during last five years. As per the Economic Survey-2021, the
contribution of Livestock in total agriculture and allied sector Gross Value Added (at
Constant Prices) has increased from 24.32% (2014-15) to 28.63% (2018-19). Livestock
income has become an important secondary source of income for rural families and has
assumed an important role in achieving the goal of doubling farmers’ income.

16. Role of livestock in socio-economic life of India
The livestock plays an important role in the economy of farmers. The farmers in India
maintain mixed farming system i.e. a combination of crop and livestock where the output of
one enterprise becomes the input of another enterprise thereby realize the resource efficiency.
The livestock serve the farmers in different ways.
 Income:
o Livestock is a source of subsidiary income for many families in India
especially the resource poor who maintain few heads of animals.
o Cows and buffaloes if in milk will provide regular income to the livestock
farmers through sale of milk.
o Animals like sheep and goat serve as sources of income during emergencies to
meet exigencies like marriages, treatment of sick persons, children education,
repair of houses etc.
o The animals also serve as moving banks and assets which provide economic
security to the owners.
 Employment:
o A large number of people in India being less literate and unskilled depend
upon agriculture for their livelihoods.
o But agriculture being seasonal in nature could provide employment for a
maximum of 180 days in a year.
o The land less and less land people depend upon livestock for utilizing their
labour during lean agricultural season.
 Food:
o The livestock products such as milk, meat and eggs are an important source of
animal protein to the members of the livestock owners.
o The per capita availability of milk is around 355 g / day; eggs is 69 / annum;
87
 Social security:
o The animals offer social security to the owners in terms of their status in the
society.
o The families especially the landless which own animals are better placed than
those who do not.
o Gifting of animals during marriages is a very common phenomenon in
different parts of the country.
o Rearing of animals is a part of the Indian culture. Animals are used for various
socio religious functions.
o Cows for house warming ceremonies; rams, bucks and chicken for sacrifice
during festive seasons;
o Bulls and Cows are worshipped during various religious functions. Many
owners develop attachment to their animals.
 Gender equity:
o Animal husbandry promotes gender equity.
o More than three-fourth of the labour demand in livestock production is met by
women.
o The share of women employment in livestock sector is around 90% in Punjab
and Haryana where dairying is a prominent activity and animals are stall-fed.
 Draft:
o Bullocks are the back bone of Indian agriculture. Despite lot of advancements
in the use of mechanical power in Indian agricultural operations, the Indian
farmer especially in rural areas still depend upon bullocks for various
agricultural operations.
o The bullocks are saving a lot on fuel which is a necessary input for using
mechanical power like tractors, combine harvesters etc.
o Pack animals like camels, horses, donkeys, ponies, mules etc are being
extensively used to transport goods in different parts of the country in addition
to bullocks.
88
o In situations like hilly terrains mules and ponies serve as the only alternative
to transport goods.
o Similarly, the army has to depend upon these animals to transport various
items in high areas of high altitude.
 Dung:
o In rural areas dung is used for several purposes which include fuel (dung
cakes), fertilizer (farm yard manure), and plastering material (poor man’s
cement).
Contributions of Livestock Sector to Indian Economy
 Employment:
o According to NSSO’s 68th Round Survey on Employment and
Unemployment, 16.44 million workers were engaged in the activities of
farming of animals, mixed farming, fishing and aquaculture.
 Largest Milk Producer:
o India is the largest producer of milk in the world.
o Milk production in the country was 188 million tonnes in 2018-19 with a
yearly growth rate of 6.5 percent resulting in increased per capita availability
to 394 grams per day.
 Income:
o About 20.5 million people depend upon livestock for their livelihood.
Livestock contributed 16% to the income of small farm households as
against an average of 14% for all rural households.
o Livestock provides livelihood to two-third of rural community. As per the 70th
round of NSSO, livestock rearing is a principal source of income to 3.7 per
cent of the agricultural households.
o Livestock sector contributes11% GDP and 25.6% of total Agriculture
GDP.
89
 Food:

animal protein to the members of the livestock owners. The per capita
availability of milk is around 375 g / day; eggs is 74 / annum during 2017-18.
 Social security:
o The animals offer social security to the owners in terms of their status in the
society. The families especially the landless which own animals are better
placed than those who do not.

18. Industrial Development in India
 Industrial sector is at the heart of a country’s economy; it includes the manufacturing of
goods, extraction of metals, and provision of services. All the products available for use
in the market are finished products and are the result of some industries.
 Traditionally, India had six major industries. These were Iron and Steel, Textiles, Jute,
Sugar, Cement, and Paper. Further, four new industries joined this list namely,
Petrochemical, Automobile, Information Technology (IT), and Banking & Insurance.
These industries are important for India’s economy.
 The modern industrial sector based on an organized pattern started with the
establishment of Cotton Textile Industry in Bombay in 1854 and Jute industry in 1855.
 The first paper mill was started at Ballygunge near Kolkata in 1870. Steel was first
manufactured by modern methods at Kulti in 1874. Tata Iron and Steel Company was
started at Jamshedpur in 1907.
Factors Influencing the Location of Industries:
Many important geographical factors involved in the location of individual industries are of
relative significance, e.g., availability of raw materials, power resources, water, labour,
markets and the transport facilities.
But besides such purely geographical factors influencing industrial location, there are factors
of historical, human, political and economic nature which are now tending to surpass the
force of geographical advantages. Consequently, the factors influencing the location of
industry can be divided into two broad categories i.e.
(I) Geographical factors, and
(II) Non-geographical factors
I. Geographical Factors:
Following are the important geographical factors influencing the location of
industries.
93
Factors of Industrial Location
 Availability of Raw Material
 Power Resources
 Water
 Markets
 Transport Facilities
 Topography
 Climate
 Capital
 Government Policies
 Industrial Inertia
 Efficient Organisation
 Banking Facilities
 Insurance
1. Raw Materials: The significance of raw materials in manufacturing industry is
so fundamental that it needs no emphasising. Indeed, the location of industrial
enterprises is sometimes determined simply by location of the raw materials.
Modem industry is so complex that a wide range of raw materials is necessary for
its growth.
The jute mills in West Bengal, sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh, cotton textile mills in
Maharashtra and Gujarat are concentrated close to the sources of raw materials
for this very reason. Industries like iron and steel, which use very large quantities
of coal and iron ore, losing lot of weight in the process of manufacture, are
generally located near the sources of coal and iron ore.
2. Power: Regular supply of power is a pre-requisite for the localisation of
industries. Coal, mineral oil and hydro-electricity are the three important
conventional sources of power. Most of the industries tend to concentrate at the
source of power. Similarly, the location of large and heavy industries, quite often
they are established at a point which has the best economic advantage in
obtaining power and raw materials.
Geographical Non-Geographical
94
3. Water: Water is another important requirement for industries. Many industries
are established near rivers, canals and lakes, because of this reason. Iron and steel
industry, textile industries and chemical industries require large quantities of
water, for their proper functioning.
4. Labour: No one can deny that the prior existence of a labour force is attractive to
industry unless there are strong reasons to the contrary. Labour supply is
important in two respects (a) workers in large numbers are often required; (b)
people with skill or technical expertise are needed.
5. Transport: Transport by land or water is necessary for the assembly of raw
materials and for the marketing of the finished products. The development of
railways in India, connecting the port towns with hinterland determined the
location of many industries around Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai. As industrial
development also furthers the improvement of transport facilities, it is difficult to
estimate how much a particular industry owes to original transport facilities
available in a particular area.
6. Market: The entire process of manufacturing is useless until the finished goods
reach the market. Nearness to market is essential for quick disposal of
manufactured goods. It helps in reducing the transport cost and enables the
consumer to get things at cheaper rate
7. Topography: Site requirements for industrial development are of considerable
significance. Sites, generally, should be flat and well served by adequate transport
facilities. Large areas are required to build factories. Now, there is a tendency to
set up industries in rural areas because the cost of land has shot up in urban
centres.
8. Climate: Climate plays an important role in the establishment of industries at a
place. Harsh climate is not much suitable for the establishment of industries.
There can be no industrial development in extremely hot, humid, dry or cold
climate.
95
II. Non-Geographical Factors:
Now-a-days alternative raw materials are also being used because of modern
scientific and technological developments. Availability of electric power supply
over wider areas and the increasing mobility of labour have reduced the influence
of geographical factors on the location of industries. The non-geographical factors
are those including economic, political, historical and social factors. These factors
influence our modern industries to a great extent. Following are some of the
important non- geographical factors influencing the location of industries.
1. Capital: Modem industries are capital-intensive and require huge investments.
Capitalists are available in urban centres. Big cities like Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi,
and Chennai are big industrial centres, because the big capitalists live in these
cities.
2. Government Policies: Government activity in planning the future distribution
of industries, for reducing regional disparities, elimination of pollution of air and
water and for avoiding their heavy clustering in big cities, has become no less an
important locational factor.
3. Industrial Inertia: Industries tend to develop at the place of their original
establishment, though the original cause may have disappeared. This phenomenon
is referred to as inertia, sometimes as geographical inertia and sometimes industrial
inertia. The lock industry at Aligarh is such an example.
4. Efficient Organisation: Efficient and enterprising organisation and
management is essential for running modem industry successfully. Bad
management sometimes squanders away the capital and puts the industry in
financial trouble leading to industrial ruin.
5. Banking Facilities: Establishment of industries involves daily exchange of
crores of rupees which is possible through banking facilities only. So the areas with
better banking facilities are better suited to the establishment of industries.
6. Insurance: There is a constant fear of damage to machine and man in industries
for which insurance facilities are badly needed.
96
19. Major Industrial region of India
Industrial regions emerge when a number of industries locate close to each other and share
the benefits of their closeness. They tend to concentrate on certain locations because of the
favorable local factors. Several indices are used to identify the clustering of industries,
important among them are:
• The number of industrial units
• Number of industrial workers.
• Quantum of power used for industrial purposes.
• Total industrial output.
• Value added by manufacturing, etc.
Following are the major industrial regions of India;
1. Mumbai-Pune Industrial Region
2. Hugli Industrial Region.
3. Bangalore-Tamil Nadu Industrial Region
4. Gujarat Industrial Region
5. Chotanagpur Industrial Region
6. Vishakhapatnam-Guntur Industrial Region
7. Gurgaon-Delhi-Meerut Industrial Region
8. Kolfam-Thiruvananthapuram Industrial Region.
1. Mumbai-Pune Industrial Region:
This region extends from Thane to Pune and in adjoining districts of Nashik and Solapur. In
addition, industries have grown at a rapid pace in Kolaba, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli and
Jalgaon districts also. This region owes its origin to the British rule in India.
The seeds of its growth were sown in 1774 when the island-site was obtained for construction
of Mumbai port. The opening of the first railway track of 34 kms between Mumbai and
Thane in 1853, opening of the Bhor and Thai Ghats respectively to Pune and Nashik and that
of Suez Canal in 1869 led to the development of Mumbai.
97
The growth of this industrial region is fully connected with the growth of cotton textile
industry in India. As the coal was far removed, hydel power was developed in Western Ghats.
Cotton was cultivated in the black cotton soil area of the Narmada and Tapi basins.
The partition of the country in 1947 adversely affected this region because 81% of the total
irrigated cotton area growing long staple cotton went to Pakistan. Mumbai, the nucleus of this
industrial region, is facing the current limitation of space for the expansion of the industry.
Dispersal of industries is essential to bring about decongestion.
2. The Hugli Industrial Region:
Located in West Bengal, this region extends as a narrow belt running along the river Hugli
for a distance of about 100 km from Bansbaria and Naihati in the north to Birlanagar in the
south. Industries have also developed in Midnapur district in the west. The river Hugli
offered the best site for the development of an inland river port as nucleus for the
development of Hugli industrial region.
The old trading centre of late 17th century has developed into the present industrial hub of
Kolkata. Thus Kolkata-Haora forms the nucleus of this region. It is very well- connected by
the Ganga and its tributaries with the rich hinterland of Ganga-Brahmaputra plains. Besides
navigable rivers, roads and the railways provided subsequent links to the great benefit of
Kolkata port.
The discovery of coal and iron ore in Chotanagpur plateau, tea plantations in Assam and
northern parts of West Bengal and the processing of deltaic Bengal’s jute led to the industrial
development in this region. Cheap labour could be found easily from the thickly populated
states of Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern part of U.P. Kolkata, having been designated
capital city of the British India (1773-1912) attracted large scale British investment of capital.
Establishment of first jute mill at Rishra in 1855 ushered in the era of modem industrial
clustering in this region. A chain of jute mills and other factories could be established on
either side of Hugli River with the help of Damodar valley coal. The port site was best-suited
for export of raw materials to England and import of finished goods from that country.
Location of petroleum refinery at Haldia has facilitated the development of a variety of
industries. The major centres of this industrial region are Kolkata, Haora, Haldia, Serampur,
98
Rishra, Shibpur, Naihati, Kakinara, Shamnagar, Titagarh, Sodepur, Budge Budge, Birlanagar,
Bansbaria, Belgurriah, Triveni, Hugli, Belur, etc.
Alarming rate of silting of the Hugli River was a very serious problem. The depth of water in
the channel from bay head to Kolkata docks must be kept at 9.2 metres for big ocean ships to
come in. Dredging out of the silt rapidly filling up the water channel was very costly and not
a permanent solution to save the life of Kolkata port.
The construction of Farakka barrage about 300 kms upstream on Ganga and flushing of the
channel are the only possible answers. The construction of Haldia port in the lower reaches of
Hugli to the south of Kolkata is another landmark in relieving the great pressure of cargo
ships on the port of Kolkata.
3. Bangalore-Tamil Nadu Industrial Region:
Spread in two states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, this region experienced the fastest
industrial growth in the post-independence era. Till 1960, industries were confined to
Bangalore district of Karnataka and Salem and Madurai districts of Tamil Nadu. But now
they have spread over all the districts of Tamil Nadu except Viluppuram.
This region is a cotton-growing tract and is dominated by the cotton-textile industry. In fact
cotton textile industry was the first to take roots in this region. But it has large number of
silk-manufacturing units, sugar mills, leather industry, chemicals, rail wagons, diesel engines,
radio, light engineering goods, rubber goods, medicines, aluminium, cement, glass, paper,
cigarette, match box and machine tools, etc.
This region is away from the main coal-producing areas of the country but cheap
hydroelectric power is available from Mettur, Sivasamudram, Papanasam, Pykara and
Sharavati dams. Cheap skilled labour and proximity to vast local market as well as good
climate have also favoured the concentration of industries in this region.
Madurai is known for its cotton textiles. Visvesvarayya Iron and Steel Works is located at
Bhadravati. The other important centres of this region are Sivakasi, Tiruchirapalli,
Madukottai, Mettur, Mysore and Mandya. Petroleum refinery at Chennai and Narimanam and
iron and steel plant at Salem are recent developments.
99
4. Gujarat Industrial Region:
The nucleus of this region lies between Ahmedabad and Vadodara as a result of which it is
also known as Ahmedabad-Vadodara industrial region. However, this region extends upto
Valsad and Surat in the south and Jamnagar in the west. The region corresponds to the cotton
growing tracts of the Gujarat plains and the development of this region is associated with the
location of textile industry since 1860s.
This region became important textile region with the decline of cotton textile industry in
Mumbai. Mumbai has the disadvantage of paying double freight charges for first bringing the
raw cotton from the peninsular hinterland and then despatching the finished products to
inland consuming points in India.
But Ahmedabad is nearer the sources of raw material as well as the marketing centres of the
Ganga and Satlui plains. Availability of cheap land, cheap skilled labour and other
advantages helped the cotton textile industry to develop. This major industrial region of the
country, mainly consisting of cotton textile industry, is expanding at a much faster rate in
providing a greater factory employment.
Besides textiles (cotton, silk and synthetic fibres) and petrochemical industries, other
industries are heavy and basic chemicals, dyes, pesticides, engineering, diesel engines, textile
machinery, pharmaceuticads, dairy products and food processing. The main industrial centres
of this region are Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Bharuch, Koyali, Anand, Khera, Surendranagar,
Surat, Jamnagar, Rajkot and Valsad. The region may become more important in the years to
come.
5. Chotanagpur Industrial Region:
As its name indicates, this region is located on the Chotanagpur plateau and extends over
Jharkhand, Northern Orissa and Western part of West Bengal. The birth and growth of this
region is linked with the discovery of coal in Damodar Valley and iron ore in the Jharkhand-
Orissa mineral belt. As both are found in close proximity, the region is known as the ‘Ruhr of
India’.
Besides raw materials, power is available from the dam sites in the Damodar Valley and the
thermal power stations based on the local coal. This region is surrounded by highly populated
states of Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal which provide cheap labour.
100
Heavy engineering, machine tools, fertilizers, cement, paper, locomotives and heavy
electricals are some of the other important industries in this region. Important nodal centres
of this region are Ranchi, Dhanbad, Chaibasa, Sindri, Hazaribagh, Jamshedpur, Daltonganj,
Garwa and Japla.
6. Vishakhapatnam-Guntur Industrial Region:
This industrial region extends from Vishakhapatnam district in the north-eastern part of
Andhra Pradesh to Kurnool and Prakasham districts in the south-east and covers most of the
coastal Andhra Pradesh. The industrial development of this region mainly depends upon
Vishakhapatnam and Machilipatnam ports.
Developed agriculture and rich mineral resources in the hinterlands of these ports provide
solid base to the industrial growth in this region. Coal fields of the Godavari basin are the
main source of energy. Hindustan Shipyard Ltd. set up at Vishakhapatnam, set up in 1941 is
the main focus.
Petroleum refinery at Vishakhapatnam facilitated the growth of several petrochemical
industries. Vishakhapatnam has the most modern iron and steel plant which have the
distinction of being the only plant in India having coastal location. It uses high quality iron
ore from Bailadila in Chhattisgarh.
One lead-zinc smelter is functioning in Guntur district. The other industries of this region
include sugar, textiles, paper, fertilizers, cement, aluminium and light engineering. The
important industrial centres of this region are Vishakhapatnam, Vijaywada, Vijaynagar,
Rajahmundry, Kurnool, Elum and Guntur. Recent discovery of natural gas in Krishna-
Godavari basin is likely to provide much needed energy and help in accelerated growth of
this industrial region.
7. Gurgaon-Delhi-Meerut Industrial Region:
This region developed after independence, but is one of the fastest growing regions of India.
It consists of two industrial belts adjoining Delhi. One belt extends over Agra-Mathura-
Meerut and Saharanpur in U.P. and the other between Faridabad-Gurgaon- Ambala in
Haryana.
The region is located far away from the mineral and power resources, and therefore, the
industries are light and market oriented. The region owes its development and growth to
101
hydro-electricity from Bhakra-Nangal complex and thermal power from Harduaganj,
Faridabad and Panipat.
Sugar, agricultural implements, vanaspati, textile, glass, chemicals, engineering, paper,
electronics and cycle are some of the important industries of this region. Software industry is
a recent addition, Agra and its environs have glass industry. Mathura has an oil refinery with
its petro-chemical complex. One oil refinery has been set up at Panipat also.
8. Kollam-Thiruvananthapuram Industrial Region:
This is comparatively small industrial region and spreads over Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam,
Alwaye, Emakulam and Allapuzha districts of south Kerala. The region is located far away
from the mineral belt of the country as a result of which the industrial scene here is
dominated by agricultural products processing and market oriented light industries.
Plantation agriculture and hydroelectricity provide the industrial base to this region. The main
industries are textiles, sugar, rubber, match box, glass, chemical fertilizers, food and fish
processing, paper, coconut coir products, aluminium and cement. Oil refinery set up in 1966
at Kochi provides solid base to petrochemical industries. Important industrial centres are
Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram, Alluva, Kochi, Alappuzha and Punalur.
Besides the above mentioned eight major industrial regions, India has 13 minor industrial
regions and 15 industrial districts. Their names are mentioned below:

20. Classification of Industries
Industries are part of the secondary activity. Secondary activities or manufacturing converts
raw materials into products of more value to people. The industry refers to economic
activities concerned with the production of goods, extraction of services, and provision of
services.
Industry classification or industry taxonomy is a type of economic taxonomy that classifies
companies, organizations, and traders into industrial groupings based on similar production
processes, similar products, or similar behavior in financial markets.
Industries can be classified into several groups but broadly they can be clubbed into three
categories. The following table gives an understanding of them.
Classification of
Industries
 Iron and Steel Industry
 Aluminium Industry
 Copper Industry
 Cement Industry
 Fertilizer Industry
 Glass Industry
 Lead and Zinc Industry
 Petro Chemical Industry
 Cotton Textile Industry
 Jute Industry
 Cottage Industry
 Silk Industry
 Sugar Industry
 Paper Industry
 Leather Industry
 Pharmaceutical Industry
Railway Equipments Industry 

Electronic and Computer Industry
1. On the Basis of Raw-Material and Finished Goods
 Heavy: Industries that use heavy and bulky raw materials and produce products of the
same category are called heavy industries. The iron and steel industry presents a good
example of heavy industries.
 Light: The light industries use light raw materials and produce light finished
products. Electric fans, sewing machines are light industries.
Mineral Based Industries Forest and Agro Based Industries Engineering Industries
105
2. Forest and Agro Based Industries
The agro-based industry includes indutries related to textiles, sugar, paper and
vegetable oil. These industries use agricultural products as their raw materials. Textile
industry is the largest industry in the organized sector. It comprises of (i) cotton
textiles, (ii) woollen textiles, (iii) silk textiles (iv) synthetic fibres and (v) jute textile
industries. Textiles have been a major component of the industrial sector. It accounts
for nearly a fifth of the industrial output and a third of the export earnings.
Forest-based Industry includes- the paper industry, match industry, silk industry, lac
industry, sports goods industry and handicraft. India is a leading country in lac
production. 60% of lac in the world is produced here. India is also the largest exporter
of lac in the world.
3. The Engineering Industries:
The Engineering Industry is the largest among all industrial sectors in India. It
incorporates diverse segments of industry which can be broadly divided into two
segments, namely, heavy engineering and light engineering. It is relatively less
fragmented at the top, as the competencies required are high, while it is highly
fragmented at the lower end (e.g. unbranded transformers for the retail segment) and
is dominated by smaller players. The engineering industry in India manufactures a
wide range of products, with heavy engineering goods accounting for bulk of the
production. Most of the leading players are engaged in the production of heavy
engineering goods and mainly produces high-value products using high-end
technology.
Industries can also be classified into other groups. The following table gives some examples
about them.
I. On the Basis of Strength of Labour:
1. Large Scale Industry:
Industries which employ a large number of labourers in each unit are called large-
scale industries. Cotton or jute textile industries are large scale industries.
2. Medium Scale Industries:
106
The industries which employ neither very large nor very small number of labourers
are put in the category of medium scale industries. Cycle industry, radio and
television industries are some examples of medium scale industries.
3. Small Scale Industries:
Industries which are owned and run by individuals and which employ a small number
of labourers are called small scale industries.
II. On the Basis of Raw-Material and Finished Goods:
Industries classified on the basis of raw materials and finished goods are:
1. Heavy Industries:
Industries which use heavy and bulky raw-materials and produce products of the same
category are called heavy industries. Iron and steel industry presents a good example
of heavy industries.
2. Light Industries:
The light industries use light raw-materials and produce light finished products.
Electric fans, sewing machines are light industries.
III. On the basis of Ownership:
Since the start of the planned development of Indian economy in 1951, industries are divided
in the following four classes:
1. Private Sector Industries:
Industries owned by individuals or firms such as Bajaj Auto or TISCO situated at
Jamshedpur are called private sector industries.
2. Public Sector Industries:
Industries owned by the state and its agencies like Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., or
Bhilai Steel Plant or Durgapur Steel Plant are public sector industries.
3. Joint Sector Industries:
Industries owned jointly by the private firms and the state or its agencies such as
Gujarat Alkalies Ltd., or Oil India Ltd. fall in the group of joint sector industries.
107
4. Co-operative Sector Industries:
Industries owned and run co-operatively by a group of people who are generally
producers of raw materials of the given industry such as a sugar mill owned and run
by farmers are called co-operative sector industries.
IV. Miscellaneous Industries:
Industries are also classified into the following miscellaneous categories.
1. Village Industries:
Village industries are located in villages and primarily cater to the needs of the rural
people. They usually employ local machinery such as oil extraction, grain grinding
and agricultural implements.
2. Cottage Industries:
Industries which artisans set up in their own houses, work with wood, cane, brass,
stone, etc. are called cottage industries. Handloom, khadi and leather work at the
artisans house fall in this category.
3. Consumer Goods Industries:
Consumer industries convert raw materials or primary products into commodities
directly used by the people. Textiles, bakeries, sugar, etc. are some of the consumer
goods industries.
4. Ancillary Industries:
The industries which manufacture parts and components to be used by big industries
for manufacturing heavy articles like trucks, buses, railway engines, tractors, etc. are
called ancillary industries.
5. Basic Industries:
Industries on which depend many other industries for their manufacturing processes
are called basic industries. Iron and steel industry and power generating industry are
included in this category.
108
6. Capital-Intensive Industries:
Industries requiring huge investments are called capital-intensive industries. Iron and
steel, cement and aluminium are outstanding examples of capital-intensive industries.
7. Labour-Intensive Industries:
Industries which require huge labour force for running them are called labour-
intensive industries. In these industries, labour is more important than capital. Shoe-
making and bidi-manufacturing, etc. are included in these industries.
109
21. Iron and steel industry
Iron and Steel industries are famously known as the feeders of all the other industries- heavy,
medium and light. The products of these industries are used as raw materials in other
industries like engineering goods, construction materials, defence, vehichle, medical,
scientific wauipment and variety of consumer and industrial goods.. As we learned the
industrial system, this industry comprises of various inputs, processes, and outputs. The input
includes raw material such as iron ore, labor, capital, and other infrastructure. Iron ore is then
converted into steel by various processes like smelting and refining.
Production and consumption of iron and steel is often regardes as the index of coountry’s
development. Finally, the output is steel. Steel and iron can be called as the basic material
needed in every other industry. No doubt, they are the backbone of the modern industry. In a
developing country like India, Iron and Steel industry has taken the advantage of the cheap
labor, raw material, and the ready market.
Iron and steel is a heavy industry because all the raw materials as well as finished goods are
heavy. Iron ore, coking coal and limestone are required in the ratio of approximately 4 : 2 : 1
to make steel harder. Today with 91.46 million tons of total finished steel products and 9.7
million tons of raw pig iron, India ranks 3rd after Japan and China.
Chota-nagpur plateau region has the maximum concentration of iron and steel industries.
All PSU market their steel through, Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) while TISCO
markets its produce through Tata Steel. Liberalization and Foreign Direct Investment have
given a boost to the iron & steel industry.
Location of iron and steel industry
The iron and steel industry is a huge industry and requires lots of facilities before locating it
in any place. These facilities are:-
• Raw materials like –iron ore, dolomite, aluminium, mica, silica etc.
• Power resources – coal or hydro-electric power
• Capital- it is a huge manufacturing industry therefore huge capital investment is
required.
110
• Cheap labour- it is very labour intensive industries therefore cheap and abundant
labour is needed
• Market- the final products are very heavy and there is a risk of rusting of the iron
therefore the plant should be near to Market
• Transportation.- a good transport network is required for the raw material and
finished goods to reach its destination.
• Apart from these Good Government policies, climatic condition, export-import
facilities are also required.
History of Iron and Steel Industry in India
The history of iron and steel began at least 6,000 years ago and in India steel-making can be
traced back to 400 BC when the Greek emperors used to recruit Indian archers for their army
who used arrows tipped with steel. The first notable attempt to revive steel industry in India
was made in 1874 when the Bengal Iron Works (BIW) came into being at Kulti, in West
Bengal. It produced 40,000 tons of pig iron in 1900 and continued to produce the metal until
it was taken over by Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) in 1936. But production on a
large scale became noticeable with the establishment of a steel plant in Jamshedpur in Bihar
in 1907.

Types of Iron and Steel:
Pig iron – these are the basic raw iron and it is called so because it is produced as
chunky moulded blocks.
Cast iron- it is a ferrous alloy which is heated until it liquefies, and then moulded into
different shapes of pipes and rods etc.
Wrought iron- the wrought iron is made when all the carbon is removed from the iron.
Bit structurally it is very strong and soft used to make decorative items like grills, gate
or furniture.
Steel- different types of steel are produced in an iron factory where all the carbon is
removed. these steel are sturdy and lightweight therefore used in variety of products
like pipes, utensils etc.

Major Iron and Steel industries in India
TISCO
• The Tata Iron and Steel plant lies very close to the Mumbai-Kolkata railway line and
about 240 km away from Kolkata, which is the nearest port for the export of steel.
• The rivers Subamarekha and Kharkai provide water to the plant.
• The iron ore for the plant is obtained from Noamundi and Badam Pahar and coal is
brought from Joda mines in Odisha. Coking coal comes from Jharia and west Bokaro
coalfields.
• Before 1947, there was only one iron and steel plant in the country - Tata Iron and Steel
Company Limited (TISCO). It was privately owned. After Independence, the
government took the initiative and set up several iron and steel plants.
• TISCO was started in 1907 at Sakchi, near the confluence of the rivers Subamarekha
and Kharkai in Jharkhand.
• Later on Sakchi was renamed as Jamshedpur. Geographically, Jamshedpur is the most
conveniently situated iron and steel centre in the country.
• Sakchi was chosen to set up the steel plant for several reasons. This place was only 32
km away from Kalimati station on the Bengal-Nagpur railway line.
• It was close to the iron ore, coal and manganese deposits as well as to Kolkata, which
provided a large market.
• TISCO, gets coal from Jharia coalfields, and iron ore, limestone, dolomite and
manganese from Odisha and Chhattisgarh.
• The Kharkai and Subamarekha rivers ensured sufficient water supply. Government
initiatives provided adequate capital for its later development.
IISCO
• The Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) set up its first factory at Hirapur and later
on another at Kulti.
• In 1937, the Steel corporation of Bengal was constituted in association with IISCO and
set up another iron and steel producing unit at Bumpiir (West Bengal).
• All the three plants under IISCO are located very close to Damodar valley coal fields
(Raniganj, Jharia, and Ramgarh).
• Iron ore comes from Singhbhum in Jharkhand. Water is obtained from the Barakar
River, a tributary of the Damodar.
114
• All the plants are located along the Kolkata-Asansol railway line. Unfortunately, steel
production from IISCO fell considerably in 1972-73 and the plants were taken over by
the government. Visvesvaraiya Iron and Steel Works Ltd. (VISL)
• The third integrated steel plant, the Visvesvaraiya Iron and Steel Works, initially called
the Mysore Iron and Steel Works, is located close to an iron ore producing area of
Kemangundi in the Bababudan hills.
• Limestone and manganese are also locally available. But this region has no coal. At the
beginning, charcoal obtained by burning wood from nearby forests was used as fuel till
1951.
• Afterwards, electric furnaces were installed which use hydroelectricity from the Jog
Falls hydel power project. The Bhadravati river supplies water to the plant. This plant
produces specialised steels and alloys.
• After independence, during the Second Five Year Plan (1956-61), three new integrated
steel plants were set up with foreign collaboration: Rourkela in Odisha, Bhilai in
Chhattisgarh and Durgapur in West Bengal.
• These were public sector plants under Hindustan Steel Limited (HSL). In 1973, the
Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) was created to manage these plants.
Rourkela Steel Plant
• The Rourkela Steel plant was set up in 1959 in the Sundargarh district of Odisha in
collaboration with Germany.
• The plant v/as located on the basis of proximity to raw materials, thus, minimising the
cost of transporting weight losing raw material.
• This plant has a unique locational advantage, as it receives coal from Jharia
(Jharkhand) and iron ore from Sundargarh and Kendujhar.
• The Hirakud project supplies power for the electric furnaces and water is obtained from
the Koel and Sankh rivers. Bhilai Steel Plant
• The Bhilai Steel Plant was established with Russian collaboration in Durg District of
Chhattisgarh and started production in 1959.
• The iron ore comes from Dalli-Rajhara mine, coal comes from Korba and Kargali coal
fields.
• The water comes from the Tanduladam and the power from the Korba Themal Power
Station.
• This plant also lies on the Kolkata-Mumbai railway route.
115
• The bulk of the steel produced goes to the Hindustan Shipyard at Vishakhapatnam.
Durgapur Steel Plant
• Durgapur Steel Plant, in West Bengal, was set up in collaboration with the government
the United Kingdom and started production in 1962.
• This plant lies in Raniganj and Jharia coal belt and gets iron ore from Noamundi.
• Durgapur lies on the main Kolkata-Delhi railway route.
• Hydel power and water is obtained from the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC).
Bokaro Steel Plant
• This steel plant was set up in 1964 at Bokaro with Russian collaboration.
• This plant was set up on the principle of transportation cost minimisation by creating
Bokaro-Rourkela combine.
• It receives iron ore from the Rourkela region and the wagons on return take coal to
Rourkela.
• Other raw materials come to Bokaro from within a radius of about 350 km.
• Water and Hydel power is supplied by the Damodar Valley Corporation.
Other Steel Plants
• New steel plants which were set up in the Fourth Plan period are away from the main
raw material sources. All the three plants are located in South India.
• The Vizag Steel Plant, in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh is the first port based
plant which started operating in 1992. Its port location is of advantage.
• The Vijaynagar Steel Plant at Hosapete in Kamataka was developed using indigenous
technology. This uses local iron ore and limestone. The Salem Steel Plant in Tamil Nadu
was commissioned in 1982.

22. Major Industries in India
Aluminium Industry
 Aluminium Industry is the second most important metallurgical industry in India.
Aluminium has gained popularity as a substitute of steel, copper, zinc and leads in a
number of industries because it is light metal, resistant to corrosion, a good conductor
of heat, malleable and becomes strong when it is mixed with other metals.
 India is the 2nd largest Aluminum Producer country in the world (in 2020).
 The plant for obtaining Alumina from bauxite ore for aluminium plants is located near
the cheap sources of energy i.e., electricity & hydel power supply.
 It is also the fastest-growing metal which has grown by nearly 20 times in the last
sixty years (compared to 6 to 7 times for other metals).
 The Aluminium industry comprises two basic segments: upstream and downstream.
o The upstream sector produces primary Aluminium from raw materials via
bauxite mining.
o The downstream sector comprises of processing of Aluminium into semi-
finished Aluminium goods such as rods, bars, castings, forging, etc.
 There are 8 aluminium smelting plants in the country located in Odisha (formerly
Orissa) (Nalco and Balco), West Bengal, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh,
Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.
 In 2004, India produced over 600 million tons of aluminium. Bauxite, the raw
material used in the smelters is a very bulky, dark reddish coloured rock. The flow
chart given below shows the process of manufacturing aluminium. Regular supply of
electricity and an assured source of raw material at minimum cost are the two prime
factors for location of the industry.
Bauxite mining sites in India are:
 Orissa: Orissa is the largest bauxite producing state accounting for more than half of
the total production of India. The total recoverable reserves in the state are estimated
at 1,370.5 million tonnes. The main bauxite belt is in Kalahandi and Koraput districts
and extends further into Andhra Pradesh.
117
 Jharkhand: he reserves of all grades of recoverable bauxite in Jharkhand have been
estimated at 63.5 million tonnes. These reserves are found in extensive areas of
Ranchi, Lohardaga, Palamu and Gumla districts. Some bauxite is also found in
Dumka and Munger districts. High grade ore occurs in Lohardaga and adjoining
areas.
 Maharashtra: Maharashtra accounts for about 10 per cent of the total bauxite
produced in India. The total recoverable reserves in the state have been estimated to
be of the order of 87.7 million tonnes. The largest deposits occur in Kolhapur district
capping the plateau basalts. Udgeri, Dhangarwadi, Radhanagari and Inderganj in
Kolhapur district contain rich deposits with alumina content 52 to 89 percent.
 Chhattisgarh: Chhattisgarh produces more than 6 per cent bauxite of India. The
Maikala range in Bilaspur, Durg districts and the Amarkantak plateau regions of
Surguja, Raigarh and Bilaspur are some of the areas having rich deposits of bauxite.
 Madhya Pradesh: Amarkantak plateau area, the Maikala range in Shahdol, Mandla
and Balaghat districts and the Kotni area of Jabalpur district are the main producers.

23. Role of Transport
Transport system of a country refers to the different means which carry men and material from one
place to the other. Transportation is the foundation stone of economic infrastructure. It helps in the
development of trade, commerce and industry. Transportation removes the hindrance of place and
facilitates the movement of goods from producers to consumers. It also helps in removing regional
inequalities.
Importance of Transport has beatifuuly explained by Dr. Marshall, “Most effective economic fact of
our times is not the development of manufacturing industries but that of the transport
services.”
Transportation has assumed much importance in developing economy like ours for rapid economic
growth. If agriculture and industries are supposed to be the body of the country, transportation may
be said to be the nerves and veins of the economy. These days transportation is known as the symbol
of civilization.
I Advantages of Transport:
The advantages of transport can be realised from the social and economic progress of the nation
which have been generated by this sector in India during the plan periods.
A. Economic Benefits:
(i) Better Production in both Agriculture and Industrial Sectors:
Transport system has helped in the growth in industrial and agricultural production. It has been
transporting raw materials and labour to the places of production and by carrying the products
produced by these sectors to different parts of the country and other countries of the world.
(ii) Reduction in Cost of Production:
The transportation network reduces the cost of manufactured goods and lowers the price in the
markets.
(iii) Reduction in Scarcity:
134
It helps in solving the problem of scarcity of goods and factors in different regions of the country.
(iv) Growth in Foreign Trade:
It helps in promoting foreign trade of the country. A country’s exports/imports cannot develop
without good parts, shipping and cargo facilities. Thus, transportation system makes a network for
transactions among different regions as well as with other countries.
(v) Specialization of Labour and Mobilization of Resources:
By the efficient and effective transportation system, the benefits of specialization of labour and
proper mobilization can be achieved. Thus, an economic system makes the best use of resources
through good transport system.
(vi) Promotion of Tourism:
An ideal transportation promotes tourism system or services all over the country.
(vii) Expands the Market:
Markets for both industrial and agricultural produce expand both on the domestic and international
front with the expansion of transport network. For example, through the expansion of road, rail and
water transport, it got good success making links between different parts of the country and with
other countries of the world.
B. Social Benefits:
(i) More Employment Opportunities:
Transport helps to create employment opportunities and thus, it provides employment through
helping mobility of workers. About 18 lakhs people are employed in Indian railways. In the same
way, lakhs of people are employed in roadways, shipping and air transport.
(ii) Education Expansion:
Developed means of transport helps in the expansion of education even in remote areas of the
country. It provides mobility to teachers, students and teaching aids. Means of transport are the
source of advertisement also. In this way, they also help in expanding education.
(iii) Social and Cultural Spirit:
135
Means of transport brings together persons living at different corners of the country. They exchange
their views. They have the common problems, because of their living together. Consequently social
and cultural unity emerges. Thus, developed means of transportation are also responsible for
international brotherhood.
(iv) Higher Standard of Living:
Transportation has reduced distance. As a result, we enjoy the position to use various varieties of
things produced in different corners of the world. These standard commodities increase our standard
living which depends upon goods and services, we consume.
(v) Relationship between Villages and Cities:
Means of transport has reduced distance between villages and cities. Men and materials move from
villages to cities and from cities to villages. Villagers can now avail of the employment opportunities
available in cities. Villages, in close contact of cities develop faster.
Modes of Transportation
The main modes of transportation are land, water, air and pipelines. These are used for inter-regional
and intra-regional transport, and each one (except pipelines) carries both passengers and goods.
Several places (nodes) join together by a series of routes (links) to form a pattern is called transport
network.

24. Rail Transport
Rail Transport network in India is one of the longest in the world. It facilitates the movement of
both freight and passengers and contributes to the growth of economy. The first train steamed off
from Mumbai to Thane, a distance of 34 km in 1853.
o The formal inauguration ceremony was performed on 16th April 1853, when 14 railway
carriages carrying about 400 guests left Bori Bunder at 3.30 pm "amidst the loud applause of
a vast multitude and to the salute of 21 guns." The first passenger train steamed out of
Howrah station destined for Hooghly, a distance of 24 miles, on 15th August, 1854. Thus the
first section of the East Indian Railway was opened to public traffic, inaugurating the
beginning of railway transport on the Eastern side of the subcontinent.
o The Indian Railway Network (67,368 km) is the fourth largest network in the world after
USA (2, 28,218 km), China (1,03,100 km) and Russia (85,266 km).

26. Water Transport
Waterways are an important mode of transport for both passenger and cargo traffic in India.
It is the cheapest means of transport and is most suitable for carrying heavy and bulky
material. It is a fuel-efficient and eco-friendly mode of transport.
The water transport is of two types– (a) inland waterways, and (b) oceanic waterways:
Inland Waterways
It was the chief mode of transport before the advent of railways. It, however, faced tough
competition from road and railway transport. Moreover, diversion of river water for
irrigation purposes made them non navigable in large parts of their courses. India has 14,500
km of navigable waterways, contributing about 1% to the country’s transportation. It
comprises rivers, canals, backwaters, creeks, etc. At present, 5,685 km of major rivers are
navigable by mechanised flat bottom vessels.
Inland Waterway Authority of India
It was established in 1986 for the purpose of development, maintenance and regulation of
the inland waterways. Its headquartered is in Noida while the regional centres arelocated in
Patna, Kolkata, Guwahati and Cochin.
In 2015-16, the Government of India declared 106 National Waterways under Inland
Waterways Authority of India (IWAI). It reduces the cost of transportation and lower the
carbon footprints.
Oceanic Ways
India has a vast coastline of approximate 7,517 km, including islands. Twelve major and 185
minor ports provide infrastructural support to these routes. Oceanic routes play an important
role in the transport sector of India’s economy. Approximately 95 per cent of India’s foreign
trade by volume and 70 per cent by value moves through ocean routes. Apart from
international trade, these are also used for the purpose of transportation between the islands
and the rest of the country.
144
Sagarmala Project
 It is the flagship, strategic and customer oriented initiative of Union Government to achieve
the broad objective of promoting port led economic development in India.
 The ambitious programme seeks to harness vast potential of India’s 7,500 km long coastline
and 14,500 km of potential navigable waterways following port connectivity enhancement,
port linked industrialization and coastal community development. It involves phase wise
implementation over the period of 2015-2035.

27. Oil and Gas Pipeline Network
 Oil and Gas Pipelines are the most convenient and efficient mode of transporting liquids
and gases over long distances. Even solids can also be transported by pipelines after
converting them into slurry.
 Oil India Limited (OIL) under the administrative set up of the Ministry of Petroleum and
Natural Gas is engaged in the exploration, production and transportation of crude oil and
natural gas. It was incorporated in 1959 as a company.
 Asia’s first cross country pipeline covering a distance of 1,157 km was constructed by
OIL from Naharkatiya oilfield in Assam to Barauni refinery in Bihar. It was further
extended up to Kanpur in 1966. Another extensive network of pipelines has been
constructed in the western region of India of which Ankleshwar-Koyali, Mumbai High-
Koyali and Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) are most important.
 Recently, a 1256 km long pipeline connecting Salaya (Gujarat) with Mathura (U.P.) has
been constructed. It supplies crude oil from Gujarat to Punjab (Jalandhar) via Mathura.
OIL is in the process of constructing of 660 km long pipeline from Numaligarh to
Siliguri.

communication and social-economic development. It has succeeded in touching the lives of
people across the country from delivering mails to accepting deposits and providing retail
services like bill collection, sale of forms, etc.
 The establishment of the modern postal system in India can be traced back to the second half of
the 18th century. For the facility of prepayment of postage on letters, 'Copper Tickets' , pre-paid
token stamps in 2 Annas value were introduced from Patna in 1774 by the East India Company
during the period of Warren Hastings, the then Governor General of India.

India’s first postal stamp depicted the picture of national flag of Indian. Mahatma Gandhi was
the first person whose picture was depicted on free India’s stamp (1948).
 India is divided into 23 postal circles. Each circles is divided into regions. These regions are
further divided into divisions and subdivisions.
 Pin Code System was introduced in India on 15th August, 1972 by Shriram Bhikaji Velankar.

 In simpleterm Urbanization is defined as a process of developing a rural or semi-urban
area into a fully functional and developed town, equipped with all the basic and modern
amenities.
 Urbanization can also be defined as the increase in the proportion of population of
country living in urban areas and increase in percentage of population engaged in non-
agricultural activities.
 Urbanization is closely linked to modernization, industrialization and the social process
of rationalization.
All the places which have municipality, corporation, cantonment board or notified town area
committee

The first category of urban units are known as Statutory town. These town are notified
under law by respective State/UT government and have local bodies like municipal
corporation, municipality, etc, irrespective of demographic characteristics. For example-
Vadodara (Municipal corporation), Shimla (Municipal corporation)
The second category of towns is known as Census Town. These were identified on the
basis of census 2001 data.Cities are urban areas with more than 100,000 population. Urban
areas below 100,000 are called towns in India
Similarly Census of India defines:-
Urban Agglomeration (UA): An urban agglomeration is a continuous urban spread
constituting a town and its adjoining outgrowths (OGs), or two or more physically
contiguous towns together with or without outgrowths of such towns. An Urban
152
Agglomeration must consist of at least a statutory town and its total population (i.e. all the
constituents put together) should not be less than 20,000 as per the 2001 Census. In varying
local conditions, there were similar other combinations which have been treated as urban
agglomerations satisfying the basic condition of contiguity. Examples: Greater Mumbai UA,
Delhi UA, etc.
Out Growths (OG): An Out Growth (OG) is a viable unit such as a village or a hamlet or
an enumeration block made up of such village or hamlet and clearly identifiable in terms of
its boundaries and location. Some of the examples are railway colony, university campus,
port area, military camps, etc., which have come up near a statutory town outside its
statutory limits but within the revenue limits of a village or villages contiguous to the town.
While determining the outgrowth of a town, it has been ensured that it possesses the urban
features in terms of infrastructure and amenities such as pucca roads, electricity, taps,
drainage system for disposal of waste water etc. educational institutions, post offices,
medical facilities, banks etc. and physically contiguous with the core town of the UA.
Examples: Central Railway Colony (OG), Triveni Nagar (N.E.C.S.W.) (OG), etc.
Each such town together with its outgrowth(s) is treated as an integrated urban area and is
designated as an ‘urban agglomeration’. Number of towns/UA/OG 2011, according to
Census 2011 Census are :-

31. Classification of Urban Settlements
 Urban settlement is a heavily populated area in which working population is involved in
secondary (industry) and tertiary (service) sector.
 The definition of urban settlement is mainly based upon the population size, density, local
government and economic activities of local government and economic activities of locals.
Urban Village
 It is transitional zone of urban development in which both the rural and urban functions are
observed.
 The working population in an urban village is engaged in non-agricultural activities.
However, the land use is dominated by agricultural and allied activities. Thus, it is also
termed as Rurban Centre, Market Town, Semi-Urban Town and Rural Town.
City
 It is larger than town and has greater number of economic functions especially in term of
secondary and tertiary activities having population between 10,000-99,999 is known as
city.
Metropolitan City
 According to the Census 2011, metropolitan cities are the cities of Urban Agglomeration
having population of 1 million or more. Metropolitan cities are also known as million plus

cities. Metropolitan cities are also known as million plus cities. Metropolis is essentially
the products of centralisation of administration politics and economic forces of nation.
 Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata are major metropolis of India since British rule. These
metropolis remain as a centre of economic affairs. Delhi was also included in this list after
1911 when it became the capital city of India.
Conurbation
 The word Conurbation was first used by Patrick Geddes in 1915.
 It is used to describe coalescence of urban settlement which was separated by open space,
through Ribbon Development, along the main inter-urban transport routes. Conurbations
are seen near Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai.
 A similar conurbation is developing in the north-western part of India in cities of Agra,
Mathra, Hodal, Ballabhgarh, Faridabad, Gurugram, Delhi, Sonipat, Panipat, Karnal,
Kurukshetra, Ambala, Chandigarh and Panchkula.
Megalopolis
 Megalopolis is a Greek word, meaning Great City. This word was first used by Jean
Gottmann in 1957. It is similar to conurbation and is formed when a large city sprawls and
because of its functionality or occupational structure, brings into its fold nearby towns and
cities. The population of a Megalopolis is more than 10million.
 Exopolis is a city that no longer coveys the traditional qualities of city. High growth of
outer city and city edges can be observed that led to more urban life. The foremost example
is Los Angeles and USA.

32. Functional Classification of Towns
The structure and functions of any towns varies the basis of various features, viz.,population ,
geographical location , area etc. Some towns and cities specialise in certain functions and they
are known for some specific activities, products or services. However, each town performs a
number of functions.
The major functions which the town perform are, of course , non-agricultural or tertiary in
nature. For instance, some towns perform administrative functions, some name industrial
functions , some are cultural centre and so on.
In India, first attempt was made by Amrit Lal (1959). He used the Locational Quotient (L.Q.)
method to determine the functional classification of the class I cities. According to Lal all the
class I cities of India, except a few multifunctional in nature.
Qazi Ahmad (1965) used 62 variable to classify 102 Indian cities on the basis of their functions.
 Ashok Mitra (1971,1973) used seven categories of workers as variables grouped into three
major functional type i.e. manufacturing, trade & transport and services .
M. Aurousseau (1921) recognized six classes of towns according to their functions described as
under:
Production Centres
 These are associated with industrial production and are popularly known as industrial towns
uh as Jamshedpur, Bokaro, Bhilai etc.
Production Centres
 These are associated with industrial production and are popularly known as industrial towns
uh as Jamshedpur, Bokaro, Bhilai etc.
Defence Towns
 The aim of these towns is to provide security and arrangement for defence of the country.
These towns are characterised by cantonments, barracks, military training centre, garrisons
and naval headquarters
Administrative Town
 The main function of these towns is to administer a given area under district, state of the
county fucg as New Delhi, Gandhinagar, Aizawal, Chheani, Porta Blair etc. National Capital
territory of Delhi is the largest administrative city in India.
157
Educational Towns
 The towns which grow due to their educational facilities come under this category like
Roorkee, Aligarh, Kota, Pilani etc.
Trading Centres
 There are several cities and towns in the country that depend on trade for their growth.
Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata are among the big trading centres of the country.
Mining Towns
 These are developed due to the mining activities in towns of Jharia, Singbhum, Dhanbad,
khetri etc.
Residential Towns
 These towns are developed to provide residential accommodation to urban people such as
Partapur near Meerut, Mohali near Chandigarh and Rajnagar near Ghaziabad etc.
Transport Centres
 These towns are mostly found at the junction of two different type of transportation system
(say where rail transport ends and road transport ends and road transport starts) such as
Kathgodam, Mumbai, Visakhapatnam, Agra,etc.
Seaports
 These are providing facilities of import and export. Some of the major seaports are Kandla,
Mumbai, Paradip, Haldia and Tuticorin
Religious and Cultural towns
 These towns are famous for their cultural, spiritual and religious attributes. Some of the
important towns are Haridwar, Allahabad, Ajmer, Amritsar, Bodh Gaya, Rameswaram and
Kedarnath.
Tourist and Resort Centres
 These are famous for their healthy climate, natural or man-made beauty and facilities for fun
and sports like Manali, Ooty, Darjeeling, Mussoorie, beaches of Goa and Chennai etc.
158
33. National Capital Regions of India
 In 1985, a broad plan for the development of Delhi and its surrounding areas i.e. NCR, was
started. Its boundaries were determined by statistics cum experience.
 National Capital Region (NCR) is a unique example of inter-state regional planning and
development for a region with NCT-Delhi as its core. The NCR as notified covers the whole
of NCT-Delhi and certain districts of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, covering an
area of about 55,083 sq. kms. The sub-region wise area details are as under
Facts about the National Capital Region:
 Districts in three neighbouring states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, along with
whole of the National Capital Territory of Delhi constitute the National Capital Region
(NCR) of India, as defined in National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) Act, 1985
 Delhi: Delhi constitutes about 2.9 percent of the land area of the Region.
 Areas under Uttar Pradesh: Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr,
Baghpat, Hapur and Muzaffarnagar.
 Areas under Haryana: Faridabad, Gurgaon, Mewat, Rohtak, Sonipat, Rewari, Jhajjar,
Panipat, Palwal, Mahendragarh, Bhiwani, Jind and Karnal.

plans, sub-regional plans and project plans through the participating states and the NCT,
Delhi
 To ensure proper and systematic programming by the participating states and the NCT
Delhi in regard to project formulation and phasing of development of the National
Capital Region in accordance with stages indicated in the regional plans.
 To arrange for, and oversee, the financing of selected development projects in the
NCR through central and state plan, funds and other sources of revenue.

34. Slums in India
 The word “slum” is used to describe informal settlements within cities with inadequate
housing and miserable living conditions. They are often overcrowded, with many people
crammed into very small living spaces. Slums are not a new phenomenon as they have been
a part of almost all cities, particularly during a time of urbanisation and industrialisation.
Slums are generally the only type of settlement affordable and accessible to the poor in
cities, where competition for land and profits is intense. The main reason for slum
proliferation is rapid and non-inclusive patterns of urbanisation catalysed by increasing rural
migration to urban areas.
 Slums manifest deprivation that transcends income poverty. Slum dwellers in
India are characterised by acute over-crowding, insanitary, unhealthy and
dehumanising living conditions. They are subject to insecure land tenure, lack of
access to basic minimum civic services such as safe drinking water, sanitation,
storm drainage, solid waste management, internal and approach roads, street
lighting, education and health care, and poor quality of shelter.
 Many of these habitations are located in environmentally fragile and dangerous zones prone
to landslides, floods and other disasters that make the poor residents highly vulnerable. A
significant proportion of the slum dwellers also face social burdens and health problems
worse than their non-slum and rural counterparts. Civic bodies do not provide the required
municipal services in slums on the plea that these are located on ‘illegal’ space. Moreover,
the problem’s scale is so colossal that it is beyond the means of Municipalities that lack a
buoyant fiscal base.
 Under Section-3 of the Slum Area Improvement and Clearance Act, 1956, slums have been
defined as mainly those residential areas where dwellings are in any respect unfit for human
habitation by reasons of dilapidation, overcrowding, faulty arrangements and designs of
such buildings, narrowness or faulty arrangement of streets, lack of ventilation, light,
sanitation facilities or any combination of these factors which are detrimental to safety,
health and morals.
161
 As per UN Habitat a slum is characterized by lack of durable housing, insufficient living
area, lack of access to clean water, inadequate sanitation and insecure tenure.  The slum
population in India has increased during 2001-11.
Probable reasons for upcoming slums
 Urbanization
 Industrialization
 Higher productivity in the secondary/tertiary sector against primary sector makes cities
and towns centres of economic growth and jobs
 Cities act as beacons for the rural population as they represent a higher standard of living
and offer opportunities to people not available in rural areas. This results in large scale
migration from rural to urban areas.
 Negative consequences of urban pull results in upcoming of slums characterized by
housing shortage and critical inadequacies in public utilities, overcrowding, unhygienic
conditions, etc.
Definition and types of slums – Census 2011
Three types of slums have been defined in Census, namely, Notified, Recognized and
Identified.
(i) Notified slums : All notified areas in a town or city notified as ‘Slum’ by
State, Union territories Administration or Local Government under any Act
including a ‘Slum Act’ may be considered as Notified slums
(ii) Recognized slums: All areas recognised as ‘Slum’ by State, Union territories
Administration or Local Government, Housing and Slum Boards, which may
have not been formally notified as slum under any act may be considered as
Recognized slums
(iii) Identified slums: A compact area of at least 300 population or about 60-70
households of poorly built congested tenements, in unhygienic environment
usually with inadequate infrastructure and lacking in proper sanitary and
drinking water facilities. Such areas should be identified personally by the
Charge Officer and also inspected by an officer nominated by Directorate of
162
Census Operations. This fact must be duly recorded in the charge register.
Such areas may be considered as Identified slums

2011, the number of scheduled tribes in India is 10, 42, 81,034. It is 8.6% of the total population
of India. A total of 9, 38, 19,162 people belonging to scheduled tribes reside in rural areas
whereas 1, 04, 61,872 people in urban areas. The scheduled tribes are 11.3% of the total

population of rural areas and 2.8% of urban areas. During 2001-2011 the decadal growth rate of
the population of India was 17.64%. During this period the decadal growth rate of the scheduled
tribes was 23.7%. The decadal growth rate of the scheduled tribes in rural areas was less (21.3%)
whereas it was more (49.7%) in urban areas.
Article 342
The President may, with respect to any State or Union territory, and where it is a state, after
consultation with the Governor there of by public notification, specify the tribes or tribal
communities or parts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities which shall, for the
purposes of this constitution, is deemed to be scheduled tribes in relation to that state or Union
Territory, as the case may be.
Parliament may by law include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled tribes specified in a
notification issued under clause(1) any tribe or tribal community or part of or group within any
170
tribe or tribal community, but save as aforesaid, a notification issued under the said clause shall
not be varied by any subsequent notification.
Distribution of Tribes in India
The Scheduled Tribes are notified in 30 States/UTs and the number of individual ethnic groups,
etc. notified as Scheduled Tribes is 705. The tribal population of the country, as per 2011 census,
is 10.43 crore, constituting 8.6% of the total population. 89.97% of them live in rural areas and
10.03% in urban areas. The decadal population growth of the tribal’s from Census 2001 to 2011
has been 23.66% against the 17.69% of the entire population. The sex ratio for the overall
population is 940 females per 1000 males and that of Scheduled Tribes 990 females per thousand
males.
Broadly the STs inhabit two distinct geographical area – the Central India and the North- Eastern
Area. More than half of the Scheduled Tribe population is concentrated in Central India, i.e.,
Madhya Pradesh (14.69%), Chhattisgarh (7.5%), Jharkhand (8.29%), Andhra Pradesh (5.7%),
Maharashtra (10.08%), Orissa (9.2%), Gujarat (8.55%) and Rajasthan (8.86%). The other distinct
area is the North East (Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Sikkim and
Arunachal Pradesh).
More than two-third of the ST population is concentrated only in the seven States of the country,
viz. Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.
There is no ST population in 3 States (Delhi NCR, Punjab and Haryana) and 2 UTs (Puducherry
and Chandigarh), as no Scheduled Tribe is notified.
States and union territories having maximum ratio of scheduled tribes, as per Census-2011 (in
descending order)- Lakshadweep (94.8%) > Mizoram (94.4%) > Nagaland (86.5%) >
Meghalaya (86.1%) > Arunachal Pradesh (68.8%).

renamed PTGs as PVTGs.
 In 1975, Government of India initiated to categorize the most vulnerable tribal groups as a
separate category under PTGs declaring 52 groups as such, while in 1993, an additional 23
groups were added to it making it to 75 out of 705 Scheduled Tribes in India.
